Welcome back to our Python series. Today, we're exploring a powerful and elegant feature of Python: decorators. Decorators are a way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without permanently modifying their source code. They are a great example of Python's support for metaprogramming.

At its core, a decorator is a callable that takes another function as an argument, adds some functionality to it, and returns another function. Decorators are often used for logging, timing, access control, and caching.

Let's start with a simple example. In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around just like any other variable.
```python
def say_hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}"

# You can assign a function to a variable
greet = say_hello
print(greet("Alice")) # Output: Hello, Alice
```
You can also define functions inside other functions.
```python
def outer_function(text):
    def inner_function():
        print(text)
    return inner_function

my_func = outer_function("Hello there!")
my_func() # Output: Hello there!
```
This is the foundation upon which decorators are built. Now, let's create our first decorator. We'll create a decorator that logs the name of any function that is called.
```python
def my_logger(original_function):
    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Running function: {original_function.__name__}")
        return original_function(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper_function
```
Here, `my_logger` is our decorator. It takes a function, `original_function`, as an argument. It defines a `wrapper_function` which does something before calling the original function. The `*args` and `**kwargs` are used to handle any arguments that the original function might take.

To use this decorator, you can apply it to a function using the `@` symbol, which is syntactic sugar for what's happening under the hood.
```python
@my_logger
def display_info(name, age):
    print(f"display_info ran with arguments ({name}, {age})")

display_info("John", 25)
```
This is equivalent to: `display_info = my_logger(display_info)`. When you run this, you'll see the log message from our decorator before the output of the `display_info` function.

Let's look at another practical example: a decorator to time how long a function takes to run.
```python
import time

def timer(original_function):
    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{original_function.__name__} ran in: {end_time - start_time} sec")
        return result
    return wrapper_function

@timer
def long_running_function(n):
    for i in range(n):
        sum([j*j for j in range(10000)])

long_running_function(5)
```
When you run this, the `timer` decorator will automatically calculate and print the execution time of `long_running_function`.

Decorators can also be chained, and they can take arguments themselves, which involves another layer of function nesting. While decorators can seem a bit magical at first, they are a powerful tool for writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code by separating concerns. Mastering them will certainly make you a more effective Python programmer.
