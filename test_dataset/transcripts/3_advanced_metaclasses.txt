Welcome to our advanced Python session. Today we're exploring a concept that might seem esoteric but is incredibly powerful: metaclasses. If you've ever wondered how classes themselves are created in Python, you're in the right place.

In Python, everything is an object. Integers are objects, strings are objects, functions are objects, and even classes are objects. And if a class is an object, it must have been created from something. That "something" is a metaclass. A metaclass is the class of a class. By default, the metaclass for all classes in Python is `type`.

You can see this yourself:
```python
class MyClass:
    pass

print(type(MyClass)) # Output: <class 'type'>
```
`type` is the built-in metaclass. But the fascinating part is that you can create your own metaclasses. Why would you want to do that? You can use metaclasses to modify classes automatically at the time of their creation. This is useful for things like registering classes, adding methods automatically, or enforcing coding standards.

Let's create a simple metaclass. A metaclass must inherit from `type`. The most important method to override is `__new__`. `__new__` is called before `__init__` and it's responsible for creating and returning the new class object.

Here's an example of a metaclass that adds an attribute `added_attribute` to any class that uses it:
```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # cls is the metaclass itself ('MyMeta')
        # name is the name of the class being created ('MyAwesomeClass')
        # bases is a tuple of parent classes
        # dct is a dictionary of the class's attributes and methods

        print(f"Creating class {name} with MyMeta")
        dct['added_attribute'] = "This was added by the metaclass!"
        
        # We call the parent's __new__ to actually create the class
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Now, let's use this metaclass
class MyAwesomeClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    my_attribute = "I am an attribute."

    def my_method(self):
        return "This is a method."
```
When Python encounters the definition of `MyAwesomeClass`, it sees the `metaclass=MyMeta` argument. It then calls `MyMeta.__new__` to create the `MyAwesomeClass` class object.

Now if you inspect `MyAwesomeClass`:
```python
print(MyAwesomeClass.added_attribute)
# Output: This was added by the metaclass!
```
As you can see, our metaclass intercepted the class creation process and injected a new attribute into it.

This can be used for very powerful patterns. For example, in a plugin system, you could have a metaclass that automatically registers any new plugin class into a central registry. Or in an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), a metaclass could be used to automatically generate database mapping code based on class attributes.

Let's look at a more practical example: enforcing that all subclasses of a certain class must implement a specific method.
```python
class MustImplementMethodMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        if 'my_required_method' not in dct:
            raise NotImplementedError(f"Class {name} must implement my_required_method")
        
        if not callable(dct['my_required_method']):
            raise TypeError(f"my_required_method in {name} must be a method")

        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(metaclass=MustImplementMethodMeta):
    pass

# This will raise an error
# class SubClassOne(BaseClass):
#     pass

# This will work
class SubClassTwo(BaseClass):
    def my_required_method(self):
        print("Implementation is here!")
```
Metaclasses are a deep topic and can be tricky to get right. In many cases, you might be able to achieve what you need with decorators or class inheritance. However, for framework or library development, they are an indispensable tool for advanced metaprogramming. They allow you to write more declarative, cleaner, and more powerful code by controlling how classes are constructed. Thank you for joining this advanced topic session.
