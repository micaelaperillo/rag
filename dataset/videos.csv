This lecture discusses the core elements of programs: strings, input/output, f-strings, operators, branching, and indentation. Big idea: Debug early, debug often. Write a little and test a little. Don’t write a complete program at once. It introduces too many errors. Use the Python Tutor to step through code when you see something unexpected!

An introduction to control flow and iteration through loops. Looping mechanisms include while and for loops. Lots of syntax today, be sure to get lots of practice! While loops loop as long as a condition is true and you need to make sure you don’t enter an infinite loop. For loops can loop over ranges of numbers and elements of a string.

This lecture explains iteration in simple programs like guess-and-check, binaries, and fractions in Python. Loops can iterate over any sequence of values including a range for numbers or a string. Guess-and-check provides a simple algorithm for solving problems. When the set of potential solutions is enumerable, exhaustive enumeration is guaranteed to work (eventually). Binary numbers help us understand how the machine works. Converting to binary will help us understand how decimal numbers are stored

An introduction to functions and their decomposition, abstractions, and specifications. Functions allow us to suppress detail from a user and capture computation within a black box. A programmer writes functions with 0 or more inputs and something to return. A function only runs when it is called and the entire function call is replaced with the return value.

This lecture further explores functions and their scopes and environments as well as functions as objects. Functions are first-class objects that have a type and can be assigned as a value, used as an argument for another procedure, or returned from another procedure. Being careful about environments enables the creation of concise, easily read code.

This lecture explores list operations and mutability: mutation, aliasing, and tricky examples with loops over L. Lists and tuples provide a way to organize data that naturally supports iterative functions. Tuples are useful when you have data that doesn’t need to change, e.g., (latitude, longitude) or (page #, line #). Lists are useful in dynamic situations, e.g., a list of daily top 40 songs or a list of recently watched movies.

This lecture covers:
1. The course (10min)
2. Human language and word meaning (15 min)
3. Word2vec algorithm introduction (15 min)
4. Word2vec objective function gradients (25 min)
5. Optimization basics (5min)
6. Looking at word vectors (10 min or less)

Key learning: The (really surprising!) result that word meaning can be representing rather well by a large vector of real numbers.

This course will teach:
1. The foundations of the effective modern methods for deep learning applied to NLP. Basics first, then key methods used in NLP: recurrent networks, attention, transformers, etc.
2. A big picture understanding of human languages and the difficulties in understanding and producing them
3. An understanding of an ability to build systems (in Pytorch) for some of the major problems in NLP. Word meaning, dependency parsing, machine translation, question answering.

2. A new neural architecture: sequence-to-sequence [45 mins] - Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a way to do Machine Translation with a single end-to-end neural network. The neural network architecture is called a sequence-to-sequence model (aka seq2seq) and it involves two RNNs.
3. A new neural technique: attention [20 mins] - Attention provides a solution to the bottleneck problem.Core idea: on each step of the decoder, use direct connection to the encoder to focus
on a particular part of the source sequence.

PaCmpygFfXo,The spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore,"We implement a bigram character-level language model, which we will further complexify in followup videos into a modern Transformer language model, like GPT. In this video, the focus is on (1) introducing torch.Tensor and its subtleties and use in efficiently evaluating neural networks and (2) the overall framework of language modeling that includes model training, sampling, and the evaluation of a loss (e.g. the negative log likelihood for classification).

Useful links for practice:
- Python + Numpy tutorial from CS231n https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/ . We use torch.tensor instead of numpy.array in this video. Their design (e.g. broadcasting, data types, etc.) is so similar that practicing one is basically practicing the other, just be careful with some of the APIs - how various functions are named, what arguments they take, etc. - these details can vary.

Exercises:
E01: train a trigram language model, i.e. take two characters as an input to predict the 3rd one. Feel free to use either counting or a neural net. Evaluate the loss; Did it improve over a bigram model?
E02: split up the dataset randomly into 80% train set, 10% dev set, 10% test set. Train the bigram and trigram models only on the training set. Evaluate them on dev and test splits. What can you see?
E03: use the dev set to tune the strength of smoothing (or regularization) for the trigram model - i.e. try many possibilities and see which one works best based on the dev set loss. What patterns can you see in the train and dev set loss as you tune this strength? Take the best setting of the smoothing and evaluate on the test set once and at the end. How good of a loss do you achieve?
E04: we saw that our 1-hot vectors merely select a row of W, so producing these vectors explicitly feels wasteful. Can you delete our use of F.one_hot in favor of simply indexing into rows of W?
E05: look up and use F.cross_entropy instead. You should achieve the same result. Can you think of why we'd prefer to use F.cross_entropy instead?
E06: meta-exercise! Think of a fun/interesting exercise and complete it.

P6sfmUTpUmc,"Building makemore Part 3: Activations & Gradients, BatchNorm","We dive into some of the internals of MLPs with multiple layers and scrutinize the statistics of the forward pass activations, backward pass gradients, and some of the pitfalls when they are improperly scaled. We also look at the typical diagnostic tools and visualizations you'd want to use to understand the health of your deep network. We learn why training deep neural nets can be fragile and introduce the first modern innovation that made doing so much easier: Batch Normalization. Residual connections and the Adam optimizer remain notable todos for later video.

Exercises:
- E01: I did not get around to seeing what happens when you initialize all weights and biases to zero. Try this and train the neural net. You might think either that 1) the network trains just fine or 2) the network doesn't train at all, but actually it is 3) the network trains but only partially, and achieves a pretty bad final performance. Inspect the gradients and activations to figure out what is happening and why the network is only partially training, and what part is being trained exactly.
- E02: BatchNorm, unlike other normalization layers like LayerNorm/GroupNorm etc. has the big advantage that after training, the batchnorm gamma/beta can be ""folded into"" the weights of the preceeding Linear layers, effectively erasing the need to forward it at test time. Set up a small 3-layer MLP with batchnorms, train the network, then ""fold"" the batchnorm gamma/beta into the preceeding Linear layer's W,b by creating a new W2, b2 and erasing the batch norm. Verify that this gives the same forward pass during inference. i.e. we see that the batchnorm is there just for stabilizing the training, and can be thrown out after training is done! pretty cool.

q8SA3rM6ckI,Building makemore Part 4: Becoming a Backprop Ninja,"We take the 2-layer MLP (with BatchNorm) from the previous video and backpropagate through it manually without using PyTorch autograd's loss.backward(): through the cross entropy loss, 2nd linear layer, tanh, batchnorm, 1st linear layer, and the embedding table. Along the way, we get a strong intuitive understanding about how gradients flow backwards through the compute graph and on the level of efficient Tensors, not just individual scalars like in micrograd. This helps build competence and intuition around how neural nets are optimized and sets you up to more confidently innovate on and debug modern neural networks.

Suggested exercises:
- EX1: The n-dimensional tensor mastery challenge: Combine the `Head` and `MultiHeadAttention` into one class that processes all the heads in parallel, treating the heads as another batch dimension (answer is in nanoGPT).
- EX2: Train the GPT on your own dataset of choice! What other data could be fun to blabber on about? (A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of train.bin, val.bin. You may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a+b that just specify the problem using y=-1 in the targets (see CrossEntropyLoss ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to add? Once you have this, swole doge project: build a calculator clone in GPT, for all of +-*/. Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought traces.)
- EX3: Find a dataset that is very large, so large that you can't see a gap between train and val loss. Pretrain the transformer on this data, then initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a smaller number of steps and lower learning rate. Can you obtain a lower validation loss by the use of pretraining?
- EX4: Read some transformer papers and implement one additional feature or change that people seem to use. Does it improve the performance of your GPT?

zduSFxRajkE,Let's build the GPT Tokenizer,"The Tokenizer is a necessary and pervasive component of Large Language Models (LLMs), where it translates between strings and tokens (text chunks). Tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the LLM pipeline: they have their own training sets, training algorithms (Byte Pair Encoding), and after training implement two fundamental functions: encode() from strings to tokens, and decode() back from tokens to strings. In this lecture we build from scratch the Tokenizer used in the GPT series from OpenAI. In the process, we will see that a lot of weird behaviors and problems of LLMs actually trace back to tokenization. We'll go through a number of these issues, discuss why tokenization is at fault, and why someone out there ideally finds a way to delete this stage entirely.

l8pRSuU81PU,Let's reproduce GPT-2 (124M),"We reproduce the GPT-2 (124M) from scratch. This video covers the whole process: First we build the GPT-2 network, then we optimize its training to be really fast, then we set up the training run following the GPT-2 and GPT-3 paper and their hyperparameters, then we hit run, and come back the next morning to see our results, and enjoy some amusing model generations. Keep in mind that in some places this video builds on the knowledge from earlier videos in the Zero to Hero Playlist (see my channel).

From MIT through her PhD at Berkeley, where she pioneered meta‑learning methods, and Google Brain, Chelsea Finn has built her career around teaching machines how to learn. Now an Assistant Professor at Stanford and co‑founder of Physical Intelligence, she’s using that foundation to bring learning-driven robotics into messy, real-world environments rather than confined lab setups.

In this talk, Chelsea traces the evolution of her team’s work—from early experiments on robotic grasping and vision to today’s ambitious efforts at folding laundry, tidying kitchens, and generalizing across tasks—all without hand-crafted code. Instead, they used scalable foundation models and massive datasets, teaching robots physical common sense as they learn by doing. 

She shares stories of the rocky setbacks, the surprises hidden in data, and the moment it all clicked: robots equipped with generalizable physical intelligence can indeed adapt and assist in the unpredictable world around us.

Drawing on his work at Stanford, OpenAI, and Tesla, Andrej sees a shift underway. Software is changing, again. We’ve entered the era of “Software 3.0,” where natural language becomes the new programming interface and models do the rest.

He explores what this shift means for developers, users, and the design of software itself— that we're not just using new tools, but building a new kind of computer.

More content from Andrej: https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy

Thoughts (From Andrej Karpathy!)
0:49 - Imo fair to say that software is changing quite fundamentally again. LLMs are a new kind of computer, and you program them *in English*. Hence I think they are well deserving of a major version upgrade in terms of software.
6:06 - LLMs have properties of utilities, of fabs, and of operating systems → New LLM OS, fabbed by labs, and distributed like utilities (for now). Many historical analogies apply - imo we are computing circa ~1960s.
14:39 - LLM psychology: LLMs = ""people spirits"", stochastic simulations of people, where the simulator is an autoregressive Transformer. Since they are trained on human data, they have a kind of emergent psychology, and are simultaneously superhuman in some ways, but also fallible in many others. Given this, how do we productively work with them hand in hand?
Switching gears to opportunities...
18:16 - LLMs are ""people spirits"" → can build partially autonomous products.
29:05 - LLMs are programmed in English → make software highly accessible! (yes, vibe coding)
33:36 - LLMs are new primary consumer/manipulator of digital information (adding to GUIs/humans and APIs/programs) → Build for agents!
