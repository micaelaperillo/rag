today is a very special place or class in cs109 because this is the first class where we're actually going to be talking about probabilities about time we're a class on probability for computer scientists so get excited we will get deep into what probability actually means today before we jump into anything though a couple announcements this is a fun thing hey I like to tell stories on Fridays just one of the things I do so I'm going to tell you guys a short story to get our class started uh important announcement much more important than the Friday announcement is that section signups are open and they're going to be open until Sunday at noon you have between now and Sunday at noon to fill in your section time preferences at which point we'll close the queue so you want to make sure you get signed up before then it's not first come first serve but just make sure you hit that deadline some of you guys have not seen python before or you just like a refresher there will be an online review session at five o'clock today on Friday uh you can go check it out it will be recorded and we will post the recording uh within a reasonable time but if you can go live fantastic and then finally we're gonna do something today that's never been done before I promise you something completely unique in the world will happen by the end of lecture but quickly story time you know there's a lot of stories I can tell but maybe an interesting one is a lot of people ask me why did I grow up in Kenya and Malaysia and of course the answer is my parents they brought me to well I was born in Kenya but I lived there because they chose to live there and so the question really becomes why did my parents end up living in Kenya and Malaysia and the story was my parents were my mom had grown up in Europe and my dad had grown up in Philadelphia and then they met one day and the story of the meeting is kind of cute I guess my dad was a high school teacher and during the summer he went on a trip and my mom went on a trip in the same direction they met uh fell in love but they're living two different cities Boston Philadelphia at the time and they were doing long-distance relationships they're like um maybe we should find some place to live together so on like a date they thought you know what we should do it would be funny we should apply to jobs in different corners of the world just to see what would happen and so they applied to jobs in like Brazil and France uh and all these different places and they got a response back from a job in Jordan that was for both of them and they're like you guys could go live in the Middle East my dad like never left Philadelphia uh and so they're like okay let's go and the I guess well technically the story went they had sent a check in the mail this is like in the early 80s uh and they cashed the checks spent the money and then they're like wait we can't do this but they'd already spent the money and they couldn't return the camera that they bought so they went they're like we'll go to Jordan for a year um but they went to Amman for a year and when they're in a month they had an incredible experience and they met some Kenyan people who said hey if you like Amman You're Gonna Love Nairobi so you can come and you can teach over there so they thought they'd only be gone for a year they didn't sell any of their things um they got married over like two days notice and then went on and they said we'll call this our honeymoon and then you know when we're done with this we'll come back to the States uh but the just it never stopped for them they went to Kenya and they were there for about 15 years and then they went to Malaysia uh and they were there until earlier last year and the cutest thing is like if you ask my dad about he'd be like yeah just the honeymoon never ended which I think is just very adorable also adorable section signups how do you do it you go to section sign up form you get a form like this you have hard questions like what is your name and what is your availability of time problem sets out as you know problem set one has been out since Wednesday a couple frequently asked questions is there's that cool check answer feature it's fantastic you can know if you're doing anything right I think somebody asked this and it's just worth repeating can you check many times absolutely yeah there's not a penalty for a checking many times um are you just going to grade us on whether or not you get a green check mark no you have to give explanations for all of your answers so even if you check your answer you get the right number please explain your work because it's the process of explaining your work that we really care about and it is important that you guys learn the way of expressing ideas in this subject not just getting the right answers how much explanation should we provide we talked about this on Wednesday but certainly looking at work examples gives you an idea of what it should look like um do you have to do all your work on the app no absolutely you could do it by hand take a photo upload the photo whatever you want to do um to get your answers example answer of like what sort of explanation we want is check out the ignig machine this is a question and here's the sort of level of detail we'd like to see in an answer super small thing about half the class has started this is how many questions people have finished so like some people have finished between zero and four some people between four and six six and eight eight and twelve and ten and you know like there's even a small number of people who did the whole problem Set uh about half the class has already started and I would encourage if you haven't already started to get started as soon as possible after today's class you'll be able to do every problem on that first problem set so if you want to be done by Sunday and then just party the rest of week two you absolutely could do that uh okay in Python review session you know is going to be online and you can find the link on the website that's all we have for Logistics any questions before we jump into content okay we oh yeah question yes two of the sections are going to be online uh it might depend on demand so for the people who want online sessions I think you might be setting the time based on that demand good question to do we don't have to book rooms for online okay so in our last great class we did counting and not easy counting like pretty serious counting and we did three particular versions of counting that we're going to build upon today the three types of counting that we did last class is we talked about let's say you have n items how could you think about different ways of counting sortings of those items so orderings of those where order really matters and we need a different task which is like let's say you have n items how many ways could you choose a subset of K and that's a different task because in this case we don't really care about the ordering of the subset you choose just we care about which items were chosen in the subset and a third task we look into is let's say you have n items how many ways could you put them into say our buckets in each of these cases we often thought about distinct versus indistinct um and what I want to point out though is we had a distinct case for each of those and that's what you really need to know to take counting into probability Theory you want to know how to do sorting for distinct items you want to feel very comfortable with how you can choose K subset from n distinct items and you want to do the bucketing with n-distinct items we're going to use them today to the point where I wrote those three rules out on the board and I just instead of having our buckets I had K buckets okay a little bit of warm up to get us going back into the mindset of counting I have this whole Narrative of if you wanted to do something like make a DNA tree there's lots of calculations like this that require you to do a comparison between every one of n different elements so in this case I'm going to give you n animals and you need to do a calculation for every pair of animals for this problem I don't want you to worry about what the calculation is I want you to count how many calculations there are so n atom and animals and I want you to do a calculation for every pair how many calculations do you have to do does that question make sense and Adam and I want you to think about it so if you have an idea if clarification questions ask them now if you have an idea tell it to the person next to you clarification questions before you jump in yes yes okay so let's say you have an atom animals we have all of these different animals and I want to count how many pair unique pairs of animals are there so like this is a pair of animals but this is a different pair of animals and this is a different pair of animals so how many pairs of animals are there and there's a story here if you want to make like a DNA tree of all those animals you'd have to do a DNA comparison between every pair good question making sense okay take a moment talk about it with the person next to you let's see how many different pairs of animals are there okay just a warm up I like this problem for a few reasons one I've just needed as a computer scientist there's been many many times in my life where I had to do this calculation and I had to pause to decide how long would my calculation take and sometimes the sort of work could take you know a couple hours of compute and so you want to be thoughtful about how many comparisons you have to do I also like it because there's several different ways of coming up with an answer did anyone find a way to solve this problem just by directly inferring one of these rules yes in the back okay let's just uh you're choosing uh you're choosing two animals out of the how many there are one n we don't like to count past seven okay if you if you counted this way see your n choose two will you ever end up with animal a with itself no it doesn't give you n choose two is always thinking about you have these N Things that I'm always going to get two distinct items in N choose two do you get if you get um this first and then that second will you get a different outcome which has them reversed no okay yeah in N choose two we think of the items as distinct but we don't care about the ordering once you've chosen them so n choose two is exactly it there is another way of thinking about it a cool way of thinking about it is you can imagine this grid and here let's say you have animals a b c and here you have animals ABC we're not going to check out anything on the diagonal but we are going to do a and b and we are going to do a and C and then for B we've already compared with a we're not going to compare B with itself but we are going to do c and for C you know where we've already compared it with a and we've already compared it with b and you just kind of have these three different comparisons so if there was three animals three choose two would actually have given you three but if you took this up to more you can imagine okay it's n minus 1 plus n minus 2 every you're going to count how many things are in this upper right triangle and I think it's really interesting that for n choose two those two lead to the same answer um okay just not that important right now but just for n choose two if you counted how many things are in the upper right hand triangle if you made that equation you'd be able to prove that's equivalent to what this is if you were to decompose it so n factorial divided by K factorial times n minus K factorial okay that was just our brief little warm-up so really you want to feel very comfortable with these three counting tasks uh going forward and I know it's not easy counting is surprisingly difficult but you guys seem to be doing very well considering how hard I know it is okay and this is a small deal but um you know when I was doing my PhD the person who's sitting next to me they were doing this research problem in computer science where they were taking um samples of people's cancer cells and then they were doing this and choose to comparisons of the actual DNA to come up with evolutionary trees of how cancer was evolving within people and it led to incredible research and now it's something that people are seeing um in medical diagnosis for actually helping people's prognoses so fun little Side Story this stuff could be helpful well I guess you're just counting on my calculations you do but that's also helpful too okay the probability I need to just introduce you to two terms and these two terms are ones that we're going to evoke a lot and once you feel comfortable with these terms then we can really talk about what a probability is the first term I'd like to introduce you to is this term of a sample space I want to get really formal about talking about all of the outcomes of an experiment so let's say my experiment is flipping this ridiculously large coin look how big that is it's got one head and one tail if you think about flipping this coin there's two different outcomes we could get you can get a heads or a tails and to be really formal that set which has all the outcomes we call that the sample space so if you want to say the sample space of flipping this coin it's heads and tails the size of that sample space is two now if you had two coins you know the sample space could be heads heads Heads Tails Tails heads Tails tails you can Define your sample space like that what if you had a six-sided dice what are all the outcomes of a six-sided dice we have like one two three four five six all those different outcomes we think of the sample space if your experiment was rolling in dice just to be clear sample spaces don't have to be um they can be infinitely large so for example the number of emails in the day how many emails could you get in a day can't be negative you can get zero Ah that's what we call a good day uh one email is possible and and you know 999 999 is also possible any positive integer is a possible outcome of the experiment of seeing how many emails you got in a day so the sample space all possible outcomes it doesn't have to be uh it can be infinitely large similarly it can be continuous so your experiment could be how many you two or I'm going to look in a day and count how many YouTube hours I've watched in a day and YouTube hours could be a continuous number instead of being like two it could be 2.345 so sounds people say says the outcomes we have this formal language it can be infinite it can be real numbered yes in the Tipping two coins yeah I think in this case I'd like to think as this is coin one and this is coin two so this is coin one is a head coin two is ahead coin one's ahead coin two is a tail very good question okay so sample space it's just the formal name that we give to all the outcomes of an experiment which leads to the other terms I want to familiarize with it which is the event space if you run an experiment sometimes there's a thing you care about an event that you care about for example flipping a coin maybe the event you care about is that you have a heads so there's just one outcome in the event space that's getting ahead getting a tail doesn't give you a head maybe the thing that you care about is whether or not you got more than one head on your two coin flips and so all three of these events so head on the first coin head on the second coin or head on the first coin's tail and second coin or tail on the first coin head on the set point those three events those three outcomes satisfy that idea of getting more than one head on two coin flips so Advanced space is some subset of the sample space that satisfies something semantic something that we can name like getting more than one heads on two coins here's another example we talked about the experiment of rolling a dice and there's six outcomes but maybe three of them satisfy the event of getting a three or less on the coin so one two or three a number of emails days being less than 20. you know that could be the event that you're looking for and that could be that subset of the sample space that you care about or for example you could Define a wasted day to be more than five YouTube hours and we've all been there at some point uh and then you can say that's the subset of the sample space that I care about Okay so sample space event space some terminology at some point lecture I'll use those terms and feel free to interrupt me like hey can you remind me Chris what you meant by event space you remind me what you meant by sample space so just to put that on one slide you know you have sample space all the outcomes of the experiment and the event space how many of those satisfy some semantic event okay yeah the Subspace the sample space all the possible outcomes are the numbers it's all it's all the possible outcomes yeah and we can talk about the size of it you can ask how many things are in here and we'll often ask that question but when we say the sample space we mean all the outcomes themselves good question very good question and that's why I use the capital S capital S is for a set and then I often use a lowercase number if I was just talking about a number would have thought that an event is an item of the set but it seems like an event is a subset is there like a name or a term for like terminology for one individual item inside the sample quiz yeah we call that one outcome so this is one outcome this is one outcome this is one outcome and this is a set of outcomes that we give a semantic meaning to that's a great great question not semantically nitpicky at all okay are you guys ready to find out what a probability really is okay a probability is very simply going to be a number between 0 and 1. to which we're going to ascribe meaning towards um and I'll tell you a little bit more about that when we get into philosophy later in today's class um but let's say you talk about a probability an event occurring we can write it as P of e and that says what's the probably this event occurring again this is like the events that we just talked about in the previous slide sometimes you'll see different notation like PR of e it's the same thing but just like a little bit faster and these people could be like I'm so fancy right now but that's not important there's still this is indication for a probability and even though it's a number between zero and one that we ascribe meaning to there was a moment about 150 years ago when people started to formalize what they really meant when they talked about a probability when we talk about a probability of an event imagine you were to repeat infinite experiments so there'll be infinite times that you'd roll your dice what's the ratio between number of times that those experiments led to your event divided by the number of experiences you've run so as you approach Infinity how does this ratio what does this ratio approach in the limit so lots lots of experiments as it gets to Infinity the ratio of successes to number experience you run that's what we really mean by a probability to make this a little bit concrete let's say n is the number of times I run a trial in this case I'm going to be throwing a dart at this board the event is that I hit the target when we give this primal definition of what a probability is intuitively it's saying we're going to not run one experiment in this case I threw one Dart and it didn't hit the board so the probability looks like it's a zero don't run two experiments in this case that Dart did hit the board so you can say I've run two experiments one of which is hit the board so that ratio is 0.5 this definition like as that probability or as the number of experiments tends towards Infinity this ratio is going to tend towards what we Define to be the probability that's kind of a wild one but it's one to nice it's a nice thing to have in your back pocket now I will complicate this a little bit in that we talk about probabilities in lots of ways and in fact thinking about probabilities and where they come from and being really expansive in your ideas of it was one of the things that allowed for Revolutions in computer science in the 90s and the 2000s so here is another way of thinking about probability is that I find is very in tune with the philosophy of cs109 imagine you're a self-driving car and you want to think about whether or not there's a motorcycle next to you this is a really interesting thing because the motorcycles either there or it's not there however for a self-driving car to make a smart decision under uncertainty it recognizes not that there is uncertainty in the world but there's uncertainty in my own understanding of the world there's uncertainty in the car's own understanding of whether or not there's a motorcycle so beyond just thinking about a probabilities as being there is still Cassidy in the world and we can think about infinite events a modern view of probability is thinking not just that there's still Cassie in the world but there's uncertainty in ourselves and probability is a language for expressing that we do not know and that makes it much more powerful it's not stochastic there's a motorcycle or there's not a motorcycle but this car has to hold a belief about whether or not there's a motorcycle because the car doesn't have perfect information so to me a probability is much more than just their stochasty in the world it is representation of what I don't know but still a number between zero and one to which we have scribe meaning and it's still the case that from the car's perspective let's say it had a 0.9 probability that there's a motorcycle there the way I would interpret that point nine as say you know if this car was to live the situation infinite times ninety percent of those times you would in fact have a motorcycle there so it is a very elegant language both for expressing just there's Randomness in our world but also we don't know things cool philosophy Philosophy for a Friday okay any questions about this you're like there's like this goes even deeper like is our world really stochastic in any way shape or form uh but that requires like a glass of wine to get into there's lots of sources of probabilities one of the sources of probability is you can derive them mathematically there's things in the world where we can use pencil and paper and figure out exactly what probabilities are there are other sources of probability sometimes we get probabilities from data sometimes we can get probabilities from doing lots of experiments uh but the one we're going to focus on at the beginning of class is the ones that we can just know perfectly from paper and that will build us some intuition for when we expand our ideas of sources of probability to things like data sets one starting place for thinking about analytic probability probably that you can get from paper is the axioms of probability the asymmet would probably come from this guy called kalmograph who I think of as being like a 1900s Harrison Ford uh no right anyways so what did Karl mcgov do uh before he got into film industry he came up with these three axioms of probability and they're very meaningful for two separate reasons one of his contributions was he said if you assume these three things we can derive all of probability Theory so once you feel that these three things are true all the rules that we learn in cs109 are going to then come from these three rules there's this other thing which is quite subtle did you know there was a time when people didn't know if probability of mathematics were the same they thought maybe probably was just this old different thing because it was so unintuitive and they weren't sure that all the rules of mathematics applied so common graph also managed to type probability Theory into the deeper roots of mathematics and show how it was in fact an instance of all the other math that had been studied and he did that going through counting and geometry it's a really cool Deep dive if you're curious about it but anyways these are the three rules you could start out with if you're learning probability though I'm going to modify them a little bit and say for our very first set of rules for probability these are the three rules that I present you the first two axons and the third one is an identity which is derived from the third Axiom these are pretty easy to accept axioms the first Axiom says every probability is a number between zero and one that's great you can't have less than zero events happen and you can't have more events happen than the experiments that you've run probabilities have to be between zero and one the second one p of s equals one what's s ample space yeah so what's this saying saying the property of sample space is one yeah put that in words for me the probability of something happening is what yeah if you're going to say these are all the outcomes the probability of some outcome happening is going to be one so it's a little tautological I told you sample space is all the things that could happen and the probability of something happening is one how about this one what's this little C up there is that like e raised to the power of the speed of light that's set notation for complement and that's a fancy way of saying what's the probability of e not happening and this is saying the probability of e not happening is one minus the probability of e happening and we'll prove this last one by the end of class okay and do you guys feel pretty comfortable about all those I say these first two are pretty total logical I like this third one I feel like you can have some like deep shower thoughts you're like this is kind of like saying everything in the world is either a potato or not a potato anyways you can think about that nor deeply okay now that we know what a probability is that zero number between zero and one there's a special case where we can derive probabilities rather easily using counting and this special case of analytical probability is called equally likely outcomes not all sample spaces are like this but for some sample space if you looked at any outcome it's just as likely as another outcome so if you think about flipping a coin we think about the heads as being just as likely as the Tails if you think about flipping two coins we think about the outcome of getting ahead on the first one ahead and the second coin is just as likely as a tail on the first coin and a tail on the second coin all those outcomes are just as likely if you roll a six-sided dice we think about all the numbers as being equally likely unless you use my pirate dice which definitely always gives you a six but that's not important right now we're talking about equally likely events if every event is equally likely what's the probability of any of the outcomes well if there is size of s outcomes in the sample space then if they're all equally likely every single outcome must have probably one divided by the number of elements in the sample space let's take coins there's two outcomes in the sample space this is claiming that every outcome has a one over two probability if you took that a step further if you cared about some event e and you want to know the probability of E it is the case that all you have to do is count how many outcomes are there from this experiment and how many outcomes satisfy the event I care about and if you count those two numbers that ratio is going to be the probability not always true only true if the outcomes are equally likely here's an example that I want you to debug you're going to play the lottery what is the sample space of playing the lottery what are the outcomes win or lose okay so if we use this logic we can figure out that the probability of winning should be the size of the events face divide by the size of this sample space so the probability win is 50 percent and why not what did I do wrong yeah okay I'm gonna teach you something and it only applies if your sample space is equally likely is it just as likely that you win as lose no definitely not uh hilariously off okay great but let me give you a situation that's quite interesting to think about where all the outcomes are equally likely I'm going to consider rolling two dice let's roll my two dice see what I get double sixes a six and a three okay fine how can I think about the probability of the sum of these two dice lots of games care about this and as I mentioned to you last class A lot of probably theory was invented by people who are horribly addicted to gambling so they spent a lot of time thinking about Dyson coins so if I wanted to think about the probability that these two dice sum up to seven when I say summer to seven you take the value of the first dice add the value of the second dice that's its sum you could think about this by taking advantage of the fact that we think the outcome space the sample space has outcomes are equally likely so here is that all the outcomes of rolling two dice and here I'm going to think of this as the value on the first Dice and this is the value on the second dice so there's a little diagram on the right to help you so this is saying you know let's say the yellow is the first dice is a five and the green dice has a two so that's what this is saying here's all the different outcomes you know one one one two it's all the 36 different outcomes are they all equally likely you know it's hard to prove that two things are equally likely when I say prove that sample space are equally likely it's hardly something that you could do mathematically is often something that you do intuitively be like do I think it's every single one here is somehow symmetrically equally likely and we could talk about it it turns out in this case they are in fact equally likely every outcome here is just as likely as all the others now if we talked about caring not just about the probability of the whole sample space but the probability of a particular event the two dice adds a seven all we have to do is we have to count the subset of the sample space where the two dice sum to seven and how many events are there well there's six in one five and two four and three three and four two and five one and six there are six different outcomes where the sum comes out to seven so if you buy my argument that the sample space is equally likely we can know the probability of two dice something to seven just by counting the event space that's six divided by the size of the sample space that's 36. okay now before I jump into things you might not believe me you might say Chris I don't think that this thing you claimed is true is in fact true so the way I'd like to convince you because I know you're computer scientist is I'd say you know okay I claim that probably Osama being six is 0.166 repeating but I can convince you by taking you to the code so I wrote a little program and this little program runs infinite times okay not infinite times but pretty close 10 million right what is this program going to do it's going to simulate that core definition of probability 10 000 times I'm going to run an experiment The Experience going to return me the dice total and the dice total is equal to seven then I'm going to count that in a running sum at the end I'm just going to print the ratio of the number of sevens I saw divide by the number of trials that I ran tqdm is this a cute thing that will give me a progress bar as I go and then a couple print statements running experiment roll one dice roll the other dice and then add them together and rolling a dice just so you know I'm not cheating is just going to give you a random number that is one two three four five or six this is also just a chance for me to show you guys some python um if any of this seems unfamiliar to you besides the TQ GM then maybe the python review session would be a good thing to go to okay should we run this whoa whoa okay my computer is like taking a moment to decide if it wants to run it I've noticed if I put in that charger that it gets unhappy but if I put in this charger it's like I'm gonna go so fast new Max man they're supposed to I got like I'm gonna have the fastest Mac in the world and then it freezes okay terminal new Terminal A little bit of time for you guys to think about what I'm doing so I'm going to run this pi oh come on too much suspense for everybody python yay simulate okay running it and this is what tqdm it does this oh isn't that so cute and it's like telling you how many it does okay so I'm running 10 million and after I run 10 million the ratio that it gives you is 0.166541 and somebody out there is like whoa Chris was right and somebody else is like ah no you're not you said it'd be one 0.166 repeating and that's not and why is it not you guys can just all say it out loud what you think I'm wrong number seven yeah this is the probability that two dice add up to seven there's six outcomes that have that where the comment next to it oh uh well I used to have a different demo uh yeah danger of comments eh okay so um but somebody has to tell me why is this number not 0.16666 repeating yes because we do go to Infinity I went to 10 million no but you're exactly right 10 million is not even close to Infinity but the closer I got to Infinity the closer this would get to the true answer so the more I run this will approach 0.166666 that's exactly right thank you very much okay so now that I've given you the structure what if I asked you the probability of the two dice equal to I actually talk about this with a person next to you because I want to make sure that everybody is following along at this point so if there's anything confusing as a person next to you otherwise what's the problem with these two dice equal to okay that's about as long as I think it's supposed to take but maybe the question came up that you want to ask everybody any questions come up in about like 30 seconds okay how do you approach this problem we have to say all the outcomes are equally likely count the sample space and then count count the event space sample space is the same there's still 36 outcomes but what is the event space now the size of the event space is one one yeah it's a set with a single item which is that item see the advanced space is all of the single item and that size of the end space is one so that your probability is one divided by 36 that's the chance of getting sum of dice equal to two I want to talk about something which is going to be so helpful for your problem sets it turns out I gave you one sample space but there's different ways that smart people could have constructed sample spaces it just turns out I gave us the one that set us up for success let me tell you about other sample spaces you could have set up for the exact same experiments you could have said I don't care about ordering I just care about the set of outcomes so you want to say like you know you got a two and a five but I'm not going to say which dice gave you the two and which dice gave you the five in that case a two five is not different from a five two that's a reasonable way of talking about the set of outcomes of your experiment here is a different way of expressing all the outcomes of experiment you could say Chris there are 11 different outcomes the sum could be two the sum could be three the sum could be four some could be five those are all the outcomes of your experiment of rolling two dice there is a problem though let's say you chose that last one you say the sample space well actually you can't get a sum of one but whatever and ah but like still wrong in this case you know you'd say the outcomes are two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and then you say you're probably if your event is the size of the event space divided so the sample space and you get like one divided by eleven and that's not even close to 0.116 that we got when we calculate or zero point was the right answer 0.166 repeating yeah that thing so what's gone wrong here it's a valid sample space it's just not the case that the outcomes are equally likely it's not just as likely to get a 7 as a two the seven is much more likely than the two so this though a valid sample space is not one where the outcomes are equally likely so you can't really use it to come up with probabilities does that make sense that one's a little bit more obvious this is the most subtle one and I want to talk about it because it'll help you all avoid a mistake on the problem set midterms Etc if you think about the dyes as indistinct and you don't really care about which one gave you numbers you just care about the set of outcomes it is a different outcome space so here's the whole sample space there's a one one one two but in this sample space a 2 1 is not different from a one two and a three one is not different from a one three does that make sense every Alchemy experiment is represented here but in this case it also turns out that the outcome space is not equally likely and again if we want to say the probability that the two dice are seven we would get three divided by 20 which is closer to the right answer but still wrong and it's still wrong because this sample space is not equally likely you're like wait why why is this one not equally likely but the other one is somebody when you have two dice that are equal to the same value you have doubles um those are counted once but when you have one two versus two one those are kind of half as often as they actually hear yes so if you want to it's easier to argue that things are not equally likely in the sample space you just need to give two outcomes and show that they're different and those two outcomes that you've printed out are different the chance of getting a 1-1 is half as likely as getting a one two there's two ways of getting one two the first ice could be one the second dice could be a two or the other way around um whereas a one one there's just one way of getting it so this outcome space looks equally likely but it is not so really tricky you want to come up with outcome services that are equally likely and the best way to do that is to think about all of your out your elements as being distinct if you think about all your elements as being distinct you will more often than not end up in equally likely outcome spaces I have the dreaded cows and pigs problem for you this is hard it is going to be difficult to think through but if you can do this this is showing that you fully are getting the complexities and Nuance of setting up equally likely outcome spaces it doesn't sound that hard I have four cows and three pigs in a toy box I will pull three of these toys out every Toya is equally likely on every draw and I want to know what's the chance I end up with one cow and two pigs I'm gonna give you guys a few options for how to approach this but then I'm going to let you choose which one you want to approach it with your first step in accounting probability problem is to choose your sample space how are you going to represent the outcomes of an experiment here and here I think you have two different choices you can think of your outcomes as ordered or unordered and you can think of each cow as being distinct from the other cows or you can think of every cow as being indistinct from the other cows and it'll be a Choose Your Own Adventure Two of which will lead to bad times and two of which will lead to Good Times so here is one you think of cow one as different from pig two and pig two is different from pig three but you think about a choice as being unordered and who I wouldn't think cow one being the third thing would be a different outcome here unordered indistinct would be two cows one Pig and three cows would be as examples of outcomes ordered is I care about order it's different from this one because I care that cow one came first and then Pig two came first the second and picked three came third and that would be different than if Pig three came first and cow one and then Pig two even though it's the same set of distinct items this one has order in My outcome space and this one doesn't and then indistinct and unordered would look like this some of you guys are thinking how can we have a choice isn't it one of these is the right way it's a beautiful piece of creativity in this part of problem solving you get to choose how you express your sample space you could make this Choice all of these are valid ways of articulating the outcomes experiments it's just two of them will lead to good answers questions about that before we jump in this is a meaty problem think about this here's a meta task while you're thinking about it you're going to choose your path but then I want you to remember what are the tasks of this counting thing Define your sample space count the size of the sample space and then count the subset of the sample space that satisfy the event you care about okay and while you think about that I will write down the thing we care about so we have four cows so four cows three pigs and we are going to draw three and we want the probability of one cow and two pigs how can you tell I spent a little bit too many times with uh toy farm animals but it turns out this is a very deep probability problem is able to pull from that okay talk about it with your friend think about it explore contemplate okay not enough time but the way I see this this is the first time you're seeing a problem with this complexity we'll do it mostly together now that you understand how deep it is but the real goal is this is one of the most important problems from today because the real goal is if you can understand the process of how to come into an answer here it will be very helpful for you going forward so four choices um did anyone go down this path you could just raise your hand a few folks did anyone go down this path not many folks anyone go down this path couple folks anyone go down this path a couple folks okay so one of the things that we should just do if you want to choose a path is you want to decide are the outcomes equally likely now it's easier to show that outcomes are not equally likely um than it is to show that outcomes are equally likely let me show you one example let's take this outcome space so we're going to not think of anything as distinct and we're just going to count how many unordered elements we get here are two different outcomes in that space three cows and three pigs are they equally likely so you have four cows and three pigs in your bag are you just as likely to get three pigs as you are to get three cows yeah the outcomes here are not equally likely so we can't use the space even if we can count fine we can't use the equally likelihood formula and something similar here you have cow cow and pig pig are two different outcomes in this space and those two are not equally likely it turns out between these two choices they're both correct there are two different paths to an answer and they both have equally likely outcome spaces even though here we think of that things as unordered here we think about them as ordered let's think about the first one the sample space is all the ways you could choose three elements how many things are in this sample space so I have seven Choice seven toys and I want to figure out all the different subsets unordered of three that I can choose from my seven and I'm putting this line here because I'm going to count my sample space here and then I'm going to count my event space over here so how many things are in that sample space seven choose three this is not talking at all about this event this is just the number of outcomes so the number of outcomes of the experiment is well there's seven outcome there's seven animals and we're choosing three of them that's getting us pretty close we have one final task to do count how many of these outcomes are of the nature that you have one cow and two pigs you're like Chris you never taught me that counting task ah but I taught you the most fundamental rules of counting Counting by or counting by steps and you can use those most fundamental rules of counting to come up with either a set of steps or an or that would get you to having one cow and two pigs so can somebody think about a two-step experiment that would get us to one cow and two pigs was that a I think you know it I think you know it yeah guessing good uh could you pick like any one cow out of the four thousand that's step one yeah exactly that's exactly right so Step One is it's like I'm gonna take my four cows I'm gonna choose one cow and step two is I'm gonna take my three pigs and I'm gonna choose two of them and there's a two-step experiment the number of outcomes in the first step doesn't change how many outcomes are in second step and that's the Only Rule you need in order to have a two-step experiment and will this two steps lead to a one cow two Pig combo you bet it will so it satisfies all the things we want so the two steps one you have your four cows and you're going to choose one of them we multiply because the step rule of counting says we can multiply and then you had your three pigs and you're going to choose two of them and if you did this math you would get the right answer for the probability of getting these one cows and two pigs so just to put what we had on the board up here you know the um oh sorry I started with ordered here's the unordered one sample space is seven choose three there's 35 different outcomes the event space there's one if four choose one ways of choosing your cow and there's three choose two ways of choosing your pigs and there's 12 outcomes there so your probability is 12 divided by 35. what if you thought about things as ordered and distinct well now if you think about it you have to construct a sample space where you care about ordering if you want to construct the sample space it matters what is first second and third so the argument here is my sample space there's seven animals for the choice of the first thing in a sample then there's six animals remaining that you could choose to be the second one and there's five animals remaining that you could choose to be the third so seven times six times five equals 210 outcomes if you think about things as being ordered now the event space is going to be a little bit harder to calculate there's three different there's three different cases where you end up um sorry this should say pick a cal as either first second or third so there's either the cow is first second or third if the cow is first you have four choices for the cow then this is going to be a pig there's three choices for a pig then there's two choices left for another Pig in this case the cow is second so three choices for your pig the cow is second you have four choices there and then for the remaining Pig there's only two pigs left to choose from in the case where the cow is third three choices for your pig two choices for the remaining Pig and then four choices for the cow that's third why can't I just add those up or rule of counting I'm saying my outcomes can either come from this case or this case or this case it must be the case that they're mutually exclusive why do I know they're Mutual exclusive why is it not possible for an outcome here to be the same as an outcome here or one cow yeah whatever I type up the the step in which you take it as matters yeah so here all the cows are first and here are all the cows are second so there can't be any overlap exactly okay so we can add these three numbers up you get 72 over 210 and very happy we can do our like you got 12 over 35 it's the exact same answer no matter if you thought of it as order or distinct so if we go back to these two choices these two were passed to happiness and these were too past to like some version of happiest but happiness where you're wrong on this problem uh and what do we notice is the same about these in both these cases we thought about your animals as being distinct were they actually distinct when I posed the problem no you made them distinct and you can do that when solving these problems okay question and then question oh you know I can um I I like know we can because it's because I'm saying there's a two-step experiment to end up with the construction of one cow and two picks the first step is you pick your cow the next step is you pick your two pigs and there are two different steps but if you put those two steps together you end up with one cow two pigs and because the outcome of one step doesn't change the number of outcomes in the second step we can just multiply we can use the step rule of counting so step one choose your cow step two choose your two pigs this is the number of outcomes in step one this is number of outcomes step two we multiply those numbers good question yes 72 over 210 versus 12 over 35 is like a multiplication factor of three factorial is that because it's like three spots to fill and for example if we were to do four spots of before factorial where is that yeah no no I think that's exactly right so you're saying if you multiply the numerator and denominator by six or three factorial you would get this numerator into this denominator and I think you're exactly right for any one unordered combination there's three factorial ways that you can mix it up so there's three factorial times more things in the sample space here fantastic yes I'm playing again how we've made the decision that it has to be distinct how interesting we just did it we're just like I got my couch I'm gonna think of them as like their own little unique butterflies should look different if we choose indistinct instead ah so if you chose indistinct you can do your counting but you'll get it wrong because the outcomes are not equally likely because the outcomes are not equally likely you can't solve this probably a problem using uh Counting so because we knew that it was not equally likely to get a cow's Pig we know that we have to think of them each as distinct yeah if you want your outcomes to be distinct because cows and pigs are not equally likely in these two cases where you thought in the indistinct it led to outcomes that were not equally likely do we mean like each of the cows is distinct stick for one another so you can tell a different between two and pig three and you can tell the difference between cow one cow two cow three can you tell the difference between cow one Pig two yeah definitely definitely and here you can think of the difference between cows and pigs but just you can't tell the difference between those two cows it's like we gave the name you're like you're Daisy and you're muddy or like whatever and so they have their own unique names okay question uh how can we tell that like um looking at them as distinct will have like people like the outcomes I wish I had a clean answer you I've heard this question many times it's a very good question it's like how can we convince ourselves that these are going to be equally likely the truth is that distinct often leads to equally likely but to really prove it it would take like a deep symmetry argument but you know I guess that's my argument here they're symmetric like there's no reason that one of these outcomes should be more likely than any other outcomes and I would just have to argue that to you as a reasonable person so I would say that it's easier or rather we should always choose the distinct options yeah if you went down this path it's not hard it's just you'll get the wrong answer because they're not equally likely yeah good good questions okay major key here make your items distinct if possible to get equally likely sample space outcomes because you need equally likely sample space outcomes if you want to use counting and I think about this as a trick a pro tip that you should use with high probability okay let's think about another problem five card poker hand we talked about on last class that there's 52 to five different hands from a normal deck of cards of that a subset have this special semantic meaning that we call a straight A straight is that you have the values of the cards are in order the suits can be anything you want but the values must be in order now all cards are already distinct so we don't have to worry about that complexity and we've already talked about how a hand of cards there's 52 choose five of those how could you count the subset of the 50 choose choose five hands which are a straight so that's my question for you guys and I do want to give you guys a second to think about it because these are meaty problems are worth thinking about so how could you now if I Define the sample space for you how could you use step rules of counting or the oral rule of County to construct all the events that lead to five cards in a row having consecutive values okay I know never enough time now what I hoped you would have gotten to by that point maybe is not the full answer but to realize that my task here is to come up with a series of steps that if you were to follow these steps would end up constructing all of the different sets that are possible from 52 cards or sorry straights that are possible for 52 cards and to use a step rule of counting we just need to come up with these sets that lead to that outcome and each outcome should show up exactly once in our Construction so what are steps that could construct all of the outcomes here yes an idea to get started well I guess the first step would be picking one card out of the 52 to get it started yeah but do you need to know the suit or do you just want to know the value um okay so you're saying pick one value to get us started do you want to pick the lowest value or do you want to pick the highest value that's not it okay well let's look at if it doesn't matter then let's pick the lowest value so we'll pick the smallest number in our set that's step one how many choices are there for picking the smallest value two can you can start straight with the two you can start at three start with four five six seven eight nine ten or Jack right jack queen king Ace no you can only get to ten yeah yeah no no we don't count that as a straight playing poker hands so two three four five six seven eight nine ten there's nine choices for the value of the first card it's like I'm teaching counting at Stanford and I can't even go from nine to ten are we sure two no you can't start with it oh oh you can start with the Nays okay you're right so it is 10 right yeah as2345 counts as a straight we're not learning poker here we're learning Counting okay at this point do you have a full hand no you've only defined one value once you know that let's say without loss of generality that you've chosen your lowest value to be a two we now need to choose the value of this card but wait do we we already know it's going to be a three and how about the value of this card four five six so once you've chose a number are we done someone thinks we're not really doesn't it can we also get a four or a five after the first card and then get a three later ah that's a very good point we don't care about ordering here so we don't think about any card as being first or last so like a two followed by three is gonna be the same as a three followed by a two so in this 52 2's uh five where in this world where we don't think about ordering it's not the you know 52 times 51 times 50 that would have meant that they're ordered cards very very cool so your event space should match your sample space so that means we're going to construct things are unordered such a good question okay so they're unordered once you've chosen one card we know the value of all the other cards are we done is this just 10 divided by 52 choose five no because I've just constructed values I haven't chosen suits I haven't told you that this one's a heart and this one's a diamond this one's a and I need to choose suits because in this sample space all my cards have suits so in this event space which is supposed to be a subset all my cards also have to have suits so let's choose it how can I choose a suit for this card the two yeah there's four choose one fun fact four choose one is four so there's four choices for the suit of card one how about for the next card but isn't there just yeah are there three suits left are there four suits left yeah because it doesn't matter what suit the two is the three can be any suit okay there's four choices for the next and then four choices for the third card four choices for the suit of the fourth card and four choices for suit of the last card I sometimes when I do this like to write arrows be like choose starting number choose the suit of the first card third second card third card fourth card fifth card um but this is ten times four times four times four times four times four will that construct us a set that is a straight oh am I missing something yeah I have an extra four no no no no no no I have the right and finally why because there's one four for every card and there's five cards you have to choose the suit of every single card okay so your choice was I want to choose the lowest number in the street so maybe in this case the lowest number in the straight is a six in this case the lowest number is a two and so let's do this your lowest number can be an ace you can be a two it can be three it can be four can five can be six seven eight nine and it can be a ten so there's ten choices for your lowest number and then once you know your lowest number the values of the next cards are already set for you if you tell me your list number six I know the old ones are 7 8 9 10 because I know it's a straight yes wait how many strings we can get as opposed to the problem that it's getting a straight but this we counted how many straights you could get but you divide that by 5225 then you get a probability so this ratio is the probability because of equally likely to outcome spaces okay one question in the back one question the deck every time you draw One it is because in this sample space when you do 50 choose two five it doesn't allow you to choose the same card twice so when you do choosing you're not getting the same thing multiple Heights it's not with replacement it's very good okay fantastic something think about here it is in the slides but we've already done it on the board um one couple Pro tips if you find this hard if you find it hard to come up with an answer just write one example of one outcome and then try and make sure that you convince yourself that every outcome is equally likely and then you construct after you've counted the sample space then you can count your event space and the probability of your event if they're equally likely is the ratio of those two numbers okay uh I'm gonna leave straight flush up here oh actually maybe this is interesting a straight flush is when all the cards also have the same suit so maybe they're all hearts or they're all clubs or they're all diamonds or they're all Spades so some people don't consider it to be a straight if it's also a straight flush so what's the probability of being a straight but not a straight flush I just want to show you in this case again the sample space is the same we're just going to try and count how many hands are straights but not straight flushes and this is just an example of okay if you count the number of straights and you don't want to include the number of straight flushes you can just subtract out how many straight flushes there are so the event space will be all the straights minus the straights which also happen to be straight flushes choose your value and then choose one suit and you don't have to choose any other suits if you're making a straight flush because there's only one choice this number is much smaller than this number so if this was your event space it'd be a much smaller probability than this if this is your event space straight flushes are much less likely than straights okay so key tip if you're given a problem that looks like an equally likelihood probability problem you want to start by defining your sample space what's the outcomes write a couple of those out and then Define what the event space is and then get to counting and counting is awesome and going to use things like the step rule of counting or the or rule of counting okay my final example n chips are manufactured and we're going to assume that exactly one is defective you're going to test some set I'm going to not test every single one of my end chips instead I'm going to test K of them and then I'm going to wrap and then I'm going to see what's the probability that the single defective chip was in my K chosen ones because if the single defective chip was in my Cade chosen ones then I catch it and if it's not in my K chosen once to test then I don't catch it which is sad times so the question is could you figure out this probability I'm going to let you guys think about but I'm also going to combine it with your two minute pedagogical pause so I'll give you some time to think about but I'm also going to give you a little bit more time so you can go to the bathroom as you like uh whatever you need sorry okay okay yeah okay I know I've thrown three pretty hard questions at you but I have this pedagogical idea that if I give you lots of examples when you get to your problem sets things will be much easier so if I give you a breadth of examples even though they're hard if you're willing to work through them it'll leave you in a good place this is another instance of a problem we have N Chips one is defective we're going to choose K randomly to test that's out of the end so K must be smaller than n and what's the probability that you in your test set you happen to get the defective group I'm going to use this as a chance to give you guys some more Pro tips let's assume this is quite hard one thing you can do that's adding complexity or one thing that's adding complexity is these variables n and K are making things a little bit harder than they need to be and if you find a problem like this hard give concrete numbers so let's say n is seven so you have seven chips and I'm just making this up so that I'm making a concrete so that when you're thinking it through you could also think about it with concrete numbers let's set K to be three and obviously when you give your answer you're going to have to give the general one where n could be any large number and K is any number that's smaller than n but by thinking about seven three doesn't it become a little bit easier okay so let's think about this what are the steps to solving a problem like this we want a probability but if we can find a way to construct a sample space that's equally likely we can solve this problem using Counting so your first step would be can I figure out how I can do a sample space where things are equally likely so you know I could think there's N Chips and I could choose maybe three of them in order and I could say There's 7 times 6 times 5 different ways of getting three chips in order thinking about them as distinct or I could say I want to choose a subset I'm thinking of the sample space so I'd say there's seven chips and we're going to choose three of them that's my sample space all the outcomes of my experiment I don't think you could use bucketing for this one so which one do you guys like which sample space and maybe we should draw an example of them so in the first example a sample space we're thinking of them as ordered so like you choose chip seven first or you know we'll call I'll say you know C7 for chip seven and then you choose C1 next for the second ship and then you choose C2 and we think about this as being ordered if you think about it as just the choose operation your sample space would be like C7 C1 C2 it's the same grid of options you had when we had the pigs and cows you think of your chips as distinct or not distinct and you can think about your outcomes as being ordered or not ordered but we learned from that experiment that it's better to think about them as distinct and in that case it turned out didn't matter if we thought about that it's ordered or not ordered yes yeah there is one thing I'm going to tell you that exactly one chip is defective oh you're saying okay you're saying that um ah you're saying that like one of these could be the defective chip like I should have a special symbol for the defective one okay so it could be like chip seven chip one and the defective one yeah yeah good good so there's if n is seven there's six healthy chips and one defective one very good helpful clarification okay what's our sample space what are all the outcomes of the experiment of choosing three to test okay seven choose three I heard a lot of people say seven choose three that's the size of the outcome space if you think about any one of those outcomes it's like it's got three chips and a set so there's seven possible chips you could have chose from you choose three and in this case if you wanted to write it more generally you would write and shoot you wouldn't write seven and three you would write add in k you know there's N Chips and you're gonna choose K of them those are all the outcomes but it doesn't describe the event space in the event space is the outcomes where you happen to get the defective shift so every outcome in the event space better have that defective chip in it so can we come up with a step a set of steps that will come up with an outcome that does have the defective chip in it yeah to choose seven choose two and multiply by seven choose one so okay but what are those two steps two would basically be choosing two non-defective ones okay so choose you have okay you have seven chips and you want to choose two that are not defective but it's not the case that all seven are non-defective so your first step is to choose your two non-defective ones right yeah and particularly it's n minus one because there's n minus one chips that are not defective and you want to choose K minus one of those six choose two so there's six non-defective chips and you're going to choose two of them there's three chips in this set that last Chip is going to be defective so we're going to choose one defective chip out of how many defective chips yeah and guess what one choose one is and guess what one multiply by anything is just one bye bye okay you guys got it that's absolutely the right answer okay um so the sample space there's n choose K different ways you could choose the chips to test of those the ones where you caught the chip you cared about you could use the step rule of counting to construct all of those outcomes first choose your defective chip and then choose your non-defective ones in our case we did this in the other order doesn't matter no it doesn't matter if you choose your defectives and then you're defected you're in your non-defectives afterwards okay now for those of you guys who are interested in not just having this formula but trying to make it a little more simple you could take this formula and apply it to the actual combinations formula and this is what that would give you and the same thing on the bottom you can apply the actual combinations formula and if you're willing to sit with this for a second if you do all your canceling it gives you K divided by n what huh so How Could You Is there a way you could have just gotten to this answer a little bit faster one way of thinking about it is to think you've got N Chips here so I'm going to draw my N Chips this is not that important by the way if you see the problem one way that's sufficient but this is just kind of fun here's my end chips of which one is defective it's kind of like you're gonna have case shots at these oh wait oh sorry let me try that again I got my formulation wrong here's my end chips and of this I'm going to choose the K uh that are uh the ones that you test now imagine we're going to place the defective chip over here so what are all the different places where you could put the defective chip like if you count the different locations where I put the defective chip how many different places could I I'm gonna I'm gonna first put all my chips there then I'm going to circle out all the ones that I'm testing and my now I'm going to imagine I'm going to throw the defective chip somewhere on one of these weird weird construction I'm just being playful here the other answer is the more straightforward one where like imagine the defective chip was a dart and I was throwing it at all the chips it could land on any of these n places right and they're all equally likely so you can imagine there's n outcomes of this super weird experiment in the sample space there's n outcomes of which if the defective chip hits here did I catch it no because it wasn't in this tested set if it lands here did I catch it how many of these outcomes will I catch there's K of them so K divided by n there's n places I can throw my defective chip of which K will lead to me catching it such a weird weird way of setting up a sample space but hey it works and it gets the right answer okay yeah because it does suggest that you can be mindful because if you're a really creative and thoughtful you could have saved yourself a lot of math but at the end of the day you know these two things do give if you did the math you get the same thing in both ways but you're right the sample space here is really large if you had to save this whole thing in memory that would be a huge problem if you had to save all these outcomes of memory not a problem at all okay um this is a little bit less important so I want to spend a little bit less time on it actually I'm going to leave it there just for something to review if you're curious um in fact though actually we are out of time so this is probably the place where I should pause and let us continue but I did promise one thing that I want to make sure I am good on so if you have a moment I told you by the end of today's class I would do something that has never been done in the history of the world you guys ready for it see this deck of cards you ready I'm Shuffling it I'm Shuffling it once not once I'm Shuffling it twice wait for it a third time and then let's just do it really fast four five six the reason I shuffle it six times is there's a professor at Stanford who's proved that using a cool thing is chaos theory once you shuffle a deck of cards with 52 cards six times every ordering is equally likely ladies and gentlemen this ordering of cards never been seen tree of the world no one has ever seen this exact ordering never ever and I am so certain of it you could get this by thinking about sample spaces and event spaces but basically how many orderings are there of cards there's 52 factorial 52 factorial is so bloody large that even if you think about a sample space of people shuffling over the history of the world no one has ever seen this set of cards before ladies and gentlemen have a fantastic weekend we'll see you guys back on Monday
