well don't stop shoot I guess we've got to stop I will uh I will soon go into withdrawal symptoms it'll last about 6 weeks but on the other hand we all are beginning to develop a sort of tired and desperate look and perhaps it's a good thing to get the semester behind us and go in to Solstice hibernation anyway there's a lot to do today I want to wrap up a couple things talk about what's next and maybe get into some big issues perhaps a little Genesis demo that sort of thing so here's what we're going to do first uh last time I talked about uh this whole idea of structure Discovery and really the the whole reason I cracked and started talking about basian methods is because of the potential utility of taking that idea one step further and finding structure in situations where you might not otherwise find it it's still an open question about whether that's the best way to think about it but uh here it goes imagine you've got a couple of stories and these circles represent the events in the story and know what you like to get out of these stories is some kind of finite State graph that describes the collection of stories so you might discover for example that these two events are quite similar and these two events are quite similar so you might use that as a basis for speculating that maybe a more compact way of representing the stuff in the story would look like this where this one let's see this one goes with this one this one goes with this one and there's a possibility of another state in between so that's the notion of basian story merging and now I'd like to show you a little bit more convincing demonstration of that here's how it goes so there are the two stories this is just a classroom demonstration no big deal but you can see there's a sort of parallel structure in there so this is the work of a graduate student uh Mark finon who process those stories to produce those kinds of events and those kinds of events that get assembled into two story graphs and the question is is this the most probable way of explaining that Corpus of stories and of course the answer is no if you merge some things like Chase and stalk then you get a simpler graph one that is more probable in the same sense that we discussed last time then you can mer merge run and flee because there similar kinds of events and finally you got think and decide boom there is your story graph and this is the same idea taken several levels higher that produce the capacity to discover in these two stories the concept of Revenge as promised at the beginning of our last discussion so sometimes the basian stuff is the right thing to do especially if you don't know anything but sometimes you do know know stuff and when you do know stuff it's possible you can do something very much more efficient this sort of thing takes clouds of computers to process but we uh learn a lot of stuff uh in the course of our development uh that we don't use a cloud of computers to figure out uh we learn how to associate the gestures of our mouth with the sounds that we make for example so I want to spend a minute or two talking about some work that um someday will be the subject of a couple of lectures I think but it's the question of how to use multiple modalities and correspondences between them to sort out both of the contributing modalities that that sounds complicated let me show you an example this is the example of zebra finch and it's um it's showing you a the result of a program written by Michael Cohen now a professor at the University of Wisconsin so the zebra finch uh learned the male zebra finch learns to sing a nice mating call mating song from its Daddy and this is what one such zebra finch sounds like nice don't you think and here is what was learned by a program that uses no probabilistic stuff at all but rather the notion of cross modal coupling can you tell the difference it's not known if this particular song turns on the female zebra finch but to the untrained human ear they sure sound a whole lot alike so how does that work here's how that works well I'm not going to show you how that works what I'm going to show you is how the classroom example works the the the the first chapter example in Cohen's PhD thesis here's what happens when we talk we produce a 48 Transformer that moves along with our speech and if we say a vowel like uh you get a fairly constant fora spectrum and you can say well where are the peaks in that 4A spectrum and how do they correspond to the appearance of of my mouth when I say the vowel so here's how that how here's how that works so here's the 4A spectrum of a particular vowel and when you smooth that those Peaks are called formats and so we're just going to keep track of the first and second forment but when I say those things I also can form an ellipse around my mouth when I say them and when I form an ellipse around my mouth when I say them that gives me this second this second modality so the question is is there a way of associating the gestures that produce the sound with the sound itself well there's the human data conveniently provided by a variety of sources uh including um Michael Cohen's wife who produced the lip Contour data on the right so that's all marked up and colorcoded according to the particular sound to to the particular vowels in English I guess there are 10 of them so uh we uh humans all learn that but guess what we don't learn it from this because we know get to work with any marked up data we learn it from that somehow uh we're exposed to the N to the natural world and we dig the vowel sounds out it's a fantastic how we do that but we do have cross modal coupling data and maybe that's got something to do with it so here is a particular cluster of sounds and what I want to know is can can I merge any of these two clusters to form a bigger cluster with a corresponding meaning so what I can do is I can say well I can watch these I know about I know what the Lip lip form is when a particular sound is made so I have these correspondences so maybe there are four of those like so and maybe the same guy projects a couple of times into that and the question is can this guy be combined with any of these guys and the answer is yes if they're close together on one side maybe that suggests you ought to Cluster them on the other side but there's a question about what close means so let's suppose that we also look at how these guys these other two guys project and suppose this guy projects twice up here and once over here and this guy down here just projects like crazy into that guy which are closer these two or these two well my diagram is getting a little closer but if you paid attention when I was drawing it you would see that this guy projects in proportion to that guy so if we look at the if we take each of these projections as the components of a vector then those two vectors are in in the same direction and the cosine between them is zero so these are two these are the two that are closest together from that from the perspective of that kind of metric and those guys are the ones who get combined like to see a demonstration yeah okay here's a demonstration based on Cohen's work so here we have two sides you could think of one side as being vowel sounds and the other side as being lip Contours or something but you don't see anything in in the diagram so far about how these things ought to be sorted out into groups so if I just take one step what I discover is that those two guys have the same projection pattern uh as each other so if I take another step I do the same thing on the other side and now in the third step the two areas that were formerly combined now form a super area and they're seem to project in the same way as the blue area so using this kind of projection idea I can gradually build up an understanding of how those regions go together and I discover in this contrived example that there's a vertical Arrangement on the right side that corresponds to a horizontal Arrangement on the left side but you say to me I like to see something a little bit more like the lip Contour data I'm just stepping through here until I get something kind of like oh that sounds good that seems good so there's a correspondence here this is all this is all madeup data gaussian you know gaussians of various shapes and and orientations let's see what happens when I run the clustering algorithm on that something definite was learned at every step we find the correspondence between the pink region on the right and the pink region on the left in some cases where the regions are rather blurred together the other side is the one that helps the system figure out how things are organized so I say this is an example of something I think is very important number one it's possible to discover regularity without being obsessively concerned with basy in probability and also that there's a that there's very likely a whole lot of this going on in human intelligence when we when we when we emerge and begin to examine and explore the world around us we're presented with a lot of unlabeled data that we got to make sense of and I believe that this kind of crossmodal coupling idea is very much likely very likely to be bound up in our understanding of uh that world that's presented to us it's fast it's direct it doesn't take thousands of data points it just happens and happens effortlessly and if this isn't built in if this isn't determined to be built in you can come back to M it in 15 years and put me in jail so I think this is really the way it works so uh there it is there's a couple of uh things to have wrapped up and now uh next thing I want to do and the uh for the rest of our last uh time together uh in this format is I talk to you about a variety of things and I'll depart from my usual practice and move to some slides so uh Dave can we have the center screen please so first A Brief Review of where we where we uh been and where we've come I think uh on the in the very first class I talked about what artificial intelligence was and I talked about how you can view it from either an engineering perspective or a scientific perspective I'm on the scientific perspective side and I think I'm nothing against applications but I think we'll have be able to make much more sophisticated and and and wonderful applications if we have not only the engineering perspective about building stuff but also the scient ific perspective about understanding the stuff to begin with so the uh both perspectives uh are important and in this case you can uh see that they all involve representations methods and architectures Dave I changed my mind could you also give me the side screen so I can see it too so uh that's that what's next the business perspective which we talked about on Thanksgiving the important IDE idea being that the knee-jerk expectation that the commercial value of something is in replacing people is something that is not sensible in the first instance and demonstrated to be unlikely and untrue in the second instance the thing that turns people on from the point of view of applications is not replacing people but making new Revenue making new capability and that at once licenses you to not have something done exclusively by a computer but something that can be done in Partnership with a person so all of the important applications of artificial intelligence involve people and computers working in tandem with each doing what they do best not with replacing people so that's that here's what a AI does that makes AI different from the rest of the fields that attempt to contribute to an understanding of intelligence uh we have the benefit of having a language uh for procedures uh we uh have all the metaphors that we that we uh are the custodians of in consequences of knowing about programming we have the metaphor of garbage collection uh we can talk about all sorts of things with programming metaphors that are um unavailable to people in other fields that are interested in Psychology we have a way to make models because uh we can write programs and when we write programs there's no question of sweeping things under the rug we have to work out the details and once we've done all that then we have opportunities to experiment that are Beyond uh the uh ability to experiment in most other fields oh magnificent experiments are done these days in developmental psychology and all the rest of uh all the other branches of psychology including MRI studies that probe into your brain and see how it's consuming sugar but it's very difficult to eate or take away way some piece of your knowledge and see how you work without it I can take the uh line drawing program that we talked about and say how will it do if it doesn't know anything about Fork Junctions and we can determine an answer uh but I can't reach into Sebastian's head here with this surgical uh procedure and take out his knowledge of fork uh Junctions it just can't be done and finally another reason why we're different is because we can put upper bounds on how much knowledge is needed in order to perform perform a certain kind of task these days with bulldozer Computing the question is uh most often ask is uh how can you uh get billions of uh things off the web and use them uh we I especially sometimes ask the opposite question which is how much how how how little knowledge can you have and still understand a story that's what's interesting to me so there's a methodological slide uh that talks to the question of how you do uh artificial intelligence particular and I suppose science in general Engineering in general there's a great tendency to in this field to fall in love with particular methods and we've had people who have devoted entire careers to neural Nets genetic algorithms basian probability and that's mechanism envy and a better way in my judgment is to say what is the problem scientific method what's the problem and then bring the right Machinery to bear on the problem rather than looking for things to do with a particular kind of Machinery so this is the methodology um the first uh articulated in a forceful Way by David Maher you want to start with the competence you're trying to understand then bring a representation to bear on it a representation that exposes the constraints and regularities because without those you can't make models and without those models you can't understand it explain it predict it or control it so it seems to make sense from a kind of MIT model centered uh point of view and only when you got all that straight do you start working on your methods and Implement in the experiment and then go around that go around that Loop so that's all I want to say by way of review I suppose uh I want to take a minute or two and just remind you of what's on the final and there's nothing to remind because you all know what's on the final already have four sections corresponding to four exams then we'll have a fifth and final question that will be everything else all that stuff you slept through will be featured there as well as the a little problem on the uh basing inference uh we didn't uh we we we rearranged the subject mostly so I could write the demonstrations so as uh so that the Basi and stuff didn't come before the uh fourth quiz therefore the basian stuff that you see on those previous quizzes is likely to be harder than the stuff that we'll ask on the final because you haven't had as much experience with it as people did last year I've got a few icons on there to remind me to tell you a few things as always open everything except for computers you can wear a costume uh you can do anything you like as long as it doesn't disturb uh your neighbor within reason well I guess if it doesn't disturb your neighbor it is within reason so maybe that's all I need to say we will I forgot I'm not sure where we're going to be but it's certainly the case that historically there are no visible clocks so we soon run out of all of our cell phones wristwatches and other time pieces as we hand them out so it pays to remember to bring some kind of uh of time piece because we won't be able to convey the time very well and finally I see a little calculator there I don't recall any examine where you where you actually needed the calculator but it's sort of a security blanket to have one people sometimes see a problem think oh my God what am I going to do I left my calculator at home so as to avoid that anxiety you might want to bring one even though you won't need it so that's the final I'm sure there are no questions are there it's obvious everybody will do well Two Shots you know of that whole thing now what to do what to do next suppose uh this subject has turned you on there are a variety of things that you should think be thinking about doing next semester and I wanted to review just a few of those uh one of them is Marvin Minsky's subject Society of Mind it's very different from this class there are no prepared lectures uh the Marvin doesn't rehearse he doesn't think about what he's going to say in advance it's a it's it's like this except it's just a conversation with Marvin so uh many people find themselves board stiff uh for for two lectures out of three but then in the third lecture Marvin will say something that you'll think about for a year or for the rest of your life that's what happens to me I'm board stiff two out of three times then the third lecture he says something and I think about it for at least a year and maybe permanently so it's an opportunity to see one of mit's true Geniuses think out loud so it's an experience that you don't want to miss because it's what you come here for is to see the the Geniuses think out loud uh speaking of geniuses then there's a there's Bob Berwick and he heroically is doing two subjects in the spring uh both of which I'd take if I could uh one is his subject on language understand understanding and the reason I take that is because I believe that language is at the center of any explanation of our intelligence so uh that's the subject I would be I suppose most inclined to take if I if I were you well maybe Minsky it's hard to say and incidentally very heroically uh Bob is also teaching a course on how Evolution Works how it really works in so far as we know how it really works as well so both of those will be offered in the spring I don't know how he does it don't know how he does too all at the same time of course there are lots of places where you can go to school and the faculty will be teaching five courses at the same time I just think they're crazy or something I don't know how that works Jerry susman um will be teaching his large scale symbolic system subject that's uh sometimes oh I for forgot what he wasn't able to call it uh something that wasn't politically correct about programming for people who really really like to program program it's a splendid course on how to build really big systems and we use the ideas in that subject in our research system because it's the only way understanding how that works is the only way that you can build systems that are too big to be built I may say a word about that a little later so those are the those are my favorite three4 picks but there's lots of other stuff too many things to cover uh the media lab brain and cognitive psychology uh there's tons of stuff out there and I would only mention that courses that have those three names on them are bound to be good these are colleagues that I think have a important perspective not necessarily one I agree with but an important perspective that you should understand Richards tabal and Sinha and now we come to my spring course the human intelligence Enterprise uh it's 6xxx not because there's anything pornographic about it but because for a long time I couldn't remember its number so I developed the habit of referring to it at 6xxx and it seems to have stuck here's what that's about yeah that might be interesting it's a it's taught like a Humanities course though no lectures uh I just talk and all of the Tas are veterans of that class so if you want to know if you should do it you can there's several you have several resources you got you can talk to them or uh I don't know you can look at the sorts of things we talk about here are some things we talk about by way of packaging yeah I can hear a little tittering there because people have discovered the last element some people take the whole subject because they want to be present for that unit but we talk about all those kinds of things and uh we uh look to see what the common elements are in all those kinds of packaging problems of the sort that you will face over and over again when you become an adult no matter what you do uh if you're become a business person an entrepreneur a military officer uh a scientist or an engineer that packaging stuff will often make the difference between whether you succeed or don't and then that's a second way you can figure out whether you want to take the subject um the content uh the Tas and then of course you can always appeal to the underground guide and that's why it's only it's very rare for someone to take XXX who hasn't been at this final lecture because they read the underground guide here is an element that appeared in the underground guide a few years back there are no exams in but there is a tradition of hacking the underground guide so this is another example of something that [Laughter] appeared so it all came about because uh early in the teaching of 6xxx I was whining to the students about the fact that uh I've been in MIT for a long time since I was a freshman and I've still have yet to have any person I report to say anything about my teaching good bad indifferent what you know nothing not a word so the students decided that it would be interesting to see if they could say something sufficiently outrageous to force a conversation between the department chairman and me and so far they've been totally unsuccessful and I've tried everything uh Winston shows up uh late if he shows up at all uh good instructor but constantly sipping from a brown paper bag you know all kinds of stuff but there it is it's a it's a lot of fun uh it's a little over subscribed so we have to have a lottery and there's about 50% chance and so on and so so forth but uh many of you will uh find it uh find it a good thing to do oh yeah and now I also want to remind myself that uh there is um a IP event it's become kind of MIT tradition it's the how to speak lecture that I give this year will be on January 28th in 6120 uh 6120 holds uh about 120 people and about 2 50 show up so if you want to go to that lecture you should show up 15 minutes early that's a little secret just between me and 6034 students it's about it's about packaging too it's a one lecture version of 6xxx but it's very nonlinear because one thing that you pick up from that one hour may make the difference between you getting the job and some other slug getting the job so uh it's one of those sorts of things that um can make a big difference in in a short period of time you may sleep through 50 minutes of the 55 minutes in that lecture and and and stay awake for that one magical five minutes when you learn something about when to tell a joke uh or how to open a lecture or how to conclude one uh or a job talk or a sales presentation or anything and that will make it worthwhile for you and then of course there's the the uh possibility of europ uh anybody who's doing europ with me uh is uh likely to be interested in what I've recently come to call the strong story hypothesis something that we've talked about from time to time yeah that's what that's what makes us humans and that's not what they are they're rangat Tans or chimpanzees even though the uh DNA that we share is it goes up and down at one point it was 96% then it went to 98 now I think it's back down to 97 but whatever we are it's not because of a huge massive difference in DNA between us and our cousins so uh in my group we uh build a Genesis system modestly called and that's what it looks like and it has in it all the sorts of things that we've talked about from time to time in 6034 and it's uh about to move into areas that are especially interesting like can you detect the onset of a possible disaster before it happens and intervene can you retrieve precence based on higher level Concepts things of that sort would you would you like to see a demonstration okay so you've seen a little bit of this before in fact I'm not not even sure what exactly um I've already shown you but let me just uh get over there to see what goes on here what I'm going to do right now is I'm just going to read uh uh read about MC Beth short pry of uh the plot not the whole thing of course just the just a few sentences about the plot right now what it's doing is it's absorbing the English and translating into a sort of internal language a sort of universal internal language it's all about trajectories and Transitions and social relationships and all that so it's being read there uh by two two different Persona each of those personas uh has a different educational background you might say it might repres they might represent different cultures So eventually uh they build up uh graphs like that and everything in white is stuff that's explicit in the story and everything that's in in Gray is stuff that's been inferred by the system so there's several layers of understanding one is what's there explicitly and another thing that's there is stuff that's readily inferred and because these Persona have different educational backgrounds you might say they see the killing of MC Beth at the end of the play In a Different Light from one another one sees it as an act of insane violence and the other sees it as a consequence of a Revenge so once you've got that capability you can do all sorts of things for example you can ask questions so let me arrange as by the way this is a live demonstration I'm thrilled the pieces that it actually works so far uh let's see uh why did Mac oops Mac the kill Duncan you all know why right dunan [Music] dunan yeah you're right he didn't actually do that on a common sense level neither Drive J nor Mr Hyde have an opinion on a reflective level neither Drive J nor Mr Hyde have an opinion that's because it didn't happen so we call these two Persona do Dr Jackal and Mr Hyde and you're going to complain right away about the spelling of Jackal aren't you well that's because with this spelling it's the speech generator makes it sound a little bit more like when we say Jackal but what really happened is that McDuff killed um McBeth on a common sense level it looks like Dr Jeff thinks McDuff kills MC Beth because McDuff isn't insane it looks like Mr Hyde thinks McDuff kills MC Beth because MC Beth angers McDuff on a reflective level it looks like Dr J thinks McDuff kills mcdeth is part of Act of insane violence it looks like Mr Hyde thinks McDuff kills mcdeth is part of X of mistake be Victory and revenge is that cool I bet you get an A if you just said that Nathan great but uh once you got this uh this ability to uh understand the story from multiple points of view you begin to think of all kinds of wonderful things you can do for example you can have Dr Jackal negotiate with Mr Hyde because Dr Jackal will be able to understand Mr Hyde's point of view and demonstrate Mr Hyde that he thinks that point of view is legitimate or Dr jaal can teach Mr Hyde the subject matter of a new domain or Dr jeal can watch what's happening in Mr Hyde's mind and avert disaster before it happens so let me just show you another situation here I want to turn on the onset detector and read another little snippet this one is about what should I do well we'll do the uh Russia Estonia cyber War it's reading background knowledge right now but pretty soon in the upper leftand corner as it begins to read the story you'll see it spotting the onset of potential Revenge operations or potential peric victories and show that they they that their their foundations beginning to emerge and giving the system an opportunity to uh to intervene so there you can see all of the things that it thinks might happen not all of them do happen but some of them do and you'll note incidentally that uh in this is another Case of Dr Jackel and Mr Hyde having different cultural perspective perspectives one's an ally of Russia one's an ally of Estonia one sees it as unwarranted revenge and the other sees it as teaching a lesson so I don't know what else we got here yeah president recall a long time ago we talked to about retrieve doing information retrieval based on vectors of keyword counts uh that's cool but not this cool this is doing on vectors of Concepts that appear in the stories such as Revenge even though the word Revenge doesn't appear anywhere so because we're able to understand the story on multiple levels we can use those higher levels that don't involve the words in the story at all to drive the retrieval process so all of that is a consequence of uh a variety of things one of which is the uh the Specialists the the that translate the English into an internal language and it's also incidentally I I mentioned a little before and uh it's also a consequence of our use of uh Jerry C's propagator architecture so a student comes into our group and we says we want to do something we say okay uh here's how the system is organized uh it's like a bunch of boxes that are wired together so you get a box and we'll tell you what the inputs are going to look like and we'll tell you what we want on the outputs and if you don't like the inputs just ignore them and if we don't like your outputs we'll just ignore that so nobody can screw up anything because they have a very circumscribed U piece of the system to work with so I can say for example um the president wanted Iraq to move toward democracy and bingo all that's starts a propagation through that Network all this would be unconvincing in my view if it weren't eventually connected to perception because if it's not eventually connected with perception it's yet another system that demonstrates how smart it can seem to be without actually knowing anything so another half of what we do is uh an early stage attempt to connect the language stuff with things that are are going on in the world so we say imagine a jumping action and there is a jumping action it's part of a test Suite developed by the defense research projects agency to drive what they call the Mind's Eye Program which was uh developed largely as a consequence of work done here at MIT focused on the idea that if we're going to understand the nature of intelligence we have to understand how language is coupled into our perceptual systems and how those perceptual systems can answer questions posed to by the language system so that's a little demo of the Genesis system here are the issues that we're trying to explore nothing too serious just the nature of what is extraordinarily fundamental to any explanation of human thinking now you might all this might turn you on you say to me well uh you sick and tired of MIT you'd like to go somewhere else for graduate school so now I've demonstrated what we do here one of the thing many things we do here I'll talk a little bit about other places you can go this is a sort of uh MIT Centric view of the world it's um it represents all of the places you could go when I was a kid uh but while I've got this Trio diagram on here just sort of testimony MIT arrogance I I remember a story often told by my colleague Peter salvic he says that when he came to a job interview from Caltech to MIT he was sitting here for 3 days nobody spoke to him So eventually said I got to do something he walked up to a graduate student and said hi my name is Peter solvic I'm from ctech and a graduate student said Caltech sucks and walked away anyway we've uh populated all these places now uh that you see here and more uh this is just a list I scratched up this morning and I'm sure I uh forgotten uh many that are that that have equal uh right to be on this list but in the end which one you go to depends on who you want to Apprentice yourself to because a graduate school is an apprenticeship and that means if you go to a place with just one person it's okay if that's the person you want to Apprentice yourself to each of these places has a different Focus because they have different people so you need to find out if there's somebody at any of these places doesn't matter if it's AI or some other field theoretical physics you got to find out if there's somebody at that place you you want to Apprentice yourself to so those site visits are really important and I would like to also stress that when you make your application to graduate school it's very different from it applying to an undergraduate school because they don't care whether their school is good for you at all they only care about one thing whether you're good for their school so don't get confused and talk about how it's a wonderful fit for you because what they're interested in is whether you're going to contribute to their research program oh I should say that if you're applying to artificial intelligence that means you don't say I'm interested in all aspects of thinking you need to be focused there's another reason why you don't say that you're interested in all aspects of thinking and that is uh the defect theory of AI career selection it seems to be uh the case strange though it may seem that people in artificial intelligence do often do specialize their research on the things that they don't do very well themselves so people who study language with the exception of Bob burck often have trouble getting out a coherent sentence and people who do hand ey coordination are the sorts who spill their coffee so don't say you want to study all of thinking because most extreme case of this though was um if you don't mind I'll tell you a story about extreme case this I we had a a visitor from Japan in the old artificial intelligence lab many years ago came for a year let's let's call him let's call him yoshiaki just to pick a name yoshiaki spent a year at the artificial intelligence lab and he left his wife in Japan and the reason was she was pregnant and at that time you could not get into a visa to the United States unless you had a small pox vaccination and because she was pregnant she didn't want to get a small poox vaccination because there's a small danger of D small danger uh to the fetus if you get a small poox vation while you're pregnant so she stayed back there so yoshiaki let us call him it was a day before he was to get on the airplane to go home I walked into his office and his desk was covered with pictures of his wife by the way yoshiaki I should tell you is a computer vision guy interested in object recognition so you might suspect he has some problem so he's looking at these pictures I thought oh my God this is a tender moment he's anticipating his return to Japan and reun re reunion with his wife so I muttered something to that effect and he looked at me like I was the king of the fools and he said uh it's not a question of tenderness I'm afraid I won't recognize her at the Tokyo Airport so so I said uh yoshiaki how can this be you study computer vision you study object recognition this is your wife how can you not how can you think you wouldn't recognize her at the Tokyo Airport and then he looks at me and God is my witness he says they all look alike well now as we come close to the end uh one of the big questions is it useful of course it's useful it's part of the toolkit now of everybody who claims to be a computer scientist what are the powerful ideas in these things well here are here's the most powerful powerful idea is the idea of powerful idea then here are a few of my favorites no no surprises there that's just Winston's picks uh but there's one more I would like to add and that is all great ideas are simple a lot of times we in MIT confuse value with complexity and many of the things that were the simplest in this subject are actually the most powerful so so be careful about confusing uh Simplicity with triviality and um thinking that something can't be important unless it's complicated and deeply mathematical It's usually the intuition that's powerful and the the mathematics is the buttressing element sometimes people argue that real intelligence is possible one of the most common arguments is well what if we had a room uh and you're in the room room and you're asked to translate some Chinese documents you've got a bunch of books uh and in the end you can do the translation but you cannot be said to understand Chinese this is the argument of California Berkle philosopher named surl so the trouble is it's also true well the argument is you know that the books aren't intelligent they're just ink on a page and the person is just a computer it's just a processor it doesn't actually have know anything so since it can't be in either the person or the books it can't be that just forgets that um there's a uh Magic that comes about when a running program when a process executes in time over knowledge that it continually contributes to so the reduction the reductionist arguments are among the many that have been ineffectually opposed to argue that um artificial intelligence is impossible but that uh Bears longer discussion let me just bring up the biggest issue in my mind which is it's not the question of whether we humans are too smart to be uh to have our intelligence duplicated or excelled in a computer it's a question of whether we're smart enough to pull it off I once had a um pet raccoon now it's illegal to have a pet raccoon but this uh this one was an orphan it's a mother had been hit by a car or some something a friend of mine brought the raccoon to me knowing I kind of like animals and I have to say I kept the raccoon for a year and that at that point she was um she wanted to go out and be on her own so so I have this raccoon and this raccoon is smarter than any dog I've ever had within a day she learned how to pry the refrigerator door open so I spent that whole year taping the refrigerator door shut every time and and then we played jokes on each other she would uh she wouldn't eat hot dogs and I wanted to eat hot dogs desperately because they're cheap and easy to serve all she would eat with was cooked chicken wings wouldn't eat hot dogs so one day I said well I'm going to play a trick on her I took a chicken bone and I stuck it in the middle of a hot dog and put it in a garbage can and she went for her jeans took over and she went for it and she was happy with hot hot dogs ever after she wouldn't let me read she would uh crawl up underneath uh the book and interfere and make me she wanted always wanted to suck on my thumb which turned blue eventually you'd be amazed at how how much a raccoon can suck it's just extremely powerful the best parts were when she would uh go bike riding with me I put on a heavy sweater because they have a pretty good grip I put on a heavy sweater and she'd kind of Mount herself on my back and kind of look out over my shoulder stopped traffic for miles around so she was really smart but you know the interesting thing is that at no point did I ever presume that that raccoon was smart enough to build a machine that was as smart as a raccoon so when we think that we can it involves a certain element of ubis that may not may or may not be justified well there it is um just a couple more things to do one of which is you should understand that um Kendra and Kenny and Yan and Martin and glb are doing a lot of stuff that's outside their job description all of these uh all of these quiz review deals that they've arranged are not in their job description I didn't ask them to do it that's all just plain old professionalism so they've been wonderful to work with and i' just like to offer them a round of applause and of course Bob and Randy and uh and and Mark uh have done F fabulous stuff as well and uh we uh of the of the staff uh the T mark Bob Randy have nothing else to do except uh wish you good hunting on the final uh and a good long winter solstice hibernation period after that and uh that is the end of the story and we hope you live happily ever after [Applause]
