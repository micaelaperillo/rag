as it it's not as hard as it might seem it's actually pretty easy as long as you do it right so let's take a look at this boosting problem there's really mainly just like with ID trees you may have noticed there's like the ID tree problem where there's a graph and all of the tests are X and y- axis tests on that graph and then there's the ID tree problem where there are a lot of crazy different classifiers about sort of characteristics that are and then all of the sort of ID tree stumps if you will are built out of those discret qualities this is an example of a boosting problem of the of the second type with a bunch of discrete qualities like evil emo transforms sparkly and it has a numerical quality number of romantic interests so it's one of basically the two kinds of boosting problems you might see another is is the um two axis cartisian problem a good example of that is the hours of sleep versus coffee uh problem which I for one am planning on doing a tutorial on Monday so that you guys sort of get a sense of both types of problem this one looks big I think it looks I mean it has 10 different vampires or non vampires to classify it has a whole bunch of possible classifiers but if you do it right you can do it fast so here's the prompt for the problem let's see after graduating MIT you get a job working for Van Hing and Summers a famous vampire hunting Consulting agency Gabriel vanh housing one of the two Founders once attended several 6034 lectures as a guest and he remembers Professor Winston's vampire identification tree lecture he assigns you the task of creating a superior classifier for Vampires by using boosting on the following data so we've got the ID number which we can use to just write things out in shorthand we've got the name of several vampires and non vampires then you see whether they're a vampire or not that's whether their classification is like a plus or a minus for for the quality vampire after that there's uh a bunch of possible ways to classify whether they're a vampire or not there's whether or not they're evil whether or not they're emo whether or not they transform and whether or not they're sparkly as well as the number of romantic interests that they have so for instance on the one hand you have Dracula who's evil but he's not emo he can transform into a bat or a a cloud of mist he not he does not Sparkle and he has five romantic interests those three vampire chicks at the beginning wiam minina Murray and Lucy westenra so um on the other hand you have like squal leonhart who's the protagonist of Final Fantasy 8 is extremely emo and doesn't have any of the other characteristics and he's not a vampire however he's a nice counter example for a possible rule that all emo people are vampires because he's very very emo and he's not a vampire so how will we go about tackling this problem with boosting well there's a whole bunch of different classifiers and if you think this is all of them like evil emo transformed sparkly romantic interests and true it's actually only half of them the other half are the opposite versions but we'll ignore them for now so if you look at these you can probably figure out what they mean evil equals Yes means vampire is what we're saying here except maybe true you might be saying why is there one that just says true the one that just says true says that everybody's a vampire you might think oh that sucks but it's not that bad since seven of the 10 samples are vampires the key crucial thing about boosting is that for any possible classifier like classifying on the evil Dimension which actually sounds like some kind of weird place that you go in a comic book but classifying on the emo Dimension or whatever as long as it's not a 5050 split of the data you're guaranteed to get so to be able to use it in some way for boosting if there's a 50/50 split it's like flipping a coin so it's useless because if you say okay if you had some other thing like gender equals male or female and let's say that was 50/50 it's not but let's say it was 50/50 between vampire and non-vampire it's a useless classifier because it would be just the same as flipping a coin you get no information now you might say wait a minute what about classifiers that get worse than 50/50 what about them might not they be even worse than a 50-50 classifier I would claim a classifier that gets less than 50/50 is still better than a classifier that gets exactly a 50/50 split uh is there a question later after remove El set so the question is in the ID tree example example you might use 50/50 classifiers in later rounds if for instance um there's a 5050 classifier except for that most of the things off of that side have been already removed let's say there's 20 data points and there's a classifier that splits at 10 and 10 um splits at 10 and 10 and it it gets half plus half minus on both sides um but all of the pluses from the right side have been removed by some other classifier you might use it that's true but in boosting you'll never use something that's a 50/50 classifier so you'll never use something that has um exactly a 50/50 chance of being correct because if it has a 50-50 chance of being correct it's useless and if it has a 5050 if it has a 50-50 chance of now sorry let me let me specify again you'll never use something that has a the 50/50 that has a 50-50 CH of giving you the right answer given the weights that's very very important and I that may be what your um what your question was getting at as I'm about to show you and as uh Patrick told you in the lecture in later rounds of boosting you change the weights of each of the 10 data points at first you start with all the weights being 1/10th the weights have to add up to one in this case you never ever choose a classifier that gets five of them right and five of them wrong in later rounds you'll never ever choose a classifier that gets half of the weight wrong exactly half of the weight wrong but half of the weight may not be half of the data points so it's possible to choose a classifier that that gets half of the data points wrong if it doesn't get half of the weight wrong and that's similar to in ID trees when um you've already gotten things right before because you'll see that the weight is going to go to the ones you got wrong so I'm not saying that you should throw out right away anything that gets five of the points wrong hell you shouldn't even throw out right away something that gets seven of the points wrong it's possible possible that you can get seven of the points wrong while getting less than half of the weight wrong if those other three points are really really annoying to get right and we'll see that later on but for insight at every step along the way we're willing to choose we're willing to choose any classifier that doesn't get 50/50 however um we want to choose the classifier that gets the most of the weight right by most of the weight at first we mean most of the points right later we will mean but exactly what I said most of the weight and if you don't understand that it's sometimes um hard to get it right away um when Patrick just lectures through and introduces the New Concept if you don't understand that you'll see what I mean when we go through all right so my my um point I was making before is what about things that get less than half of the weight right well those are always okay because you can just flip them around use their inverse and that gets more than half of the weight right it's sort of like um yeah it's sort of like um my girlfriend always tells me that she is more than 50% likely to choose the wrong direction when you're trying to go between two places which I'm kind of skeptical of but I said if that's really true then we can just go wherever you didn't say to go and we'll be more likely to go the right way so you're actually really good at finding the place that we want to go and then she's like no that won't work because then I'll I'll know that you're going to do that and I'll say the um I'll double say the wrong way and then you'll go the wrong way again but that notwithstanding you can you can see you can apply the same concept to boosting and that's why underneath of this I have all the opposite versions of all these tests so what should we be doing to um to solve this problem more quickly first let's figure out which data points are misclassified by each of these classifiers in other words if we say all the evil things are vampires and all the all the non-evil things are not vampires what do we get wrong and we if we do that for every classifier then that'll make it faster later on because later on we're going to go through classifiers and um we're going to have to add up the ones they got wrong so this chart over here is going to be extremely useful and on the test that this appeared in they even made you fill it it to help yourself out so let's see if we said that all the evil equals yes are vampires and all the evil equals no are not vampires then um I'll do the first one for you so we get all of the non vampires correct because they are all evil evals no but unfortunately we get uh we get Angel Edward cullin scen and list the leing court wrong because they are vampires and they're evil equals no apparently lot is iffy but I never uh I never read those books and the Wikipedia article said that in the end he wasn't that evil so there we go evil equals yes misclassifies 2 3 four and five all right so let's try emo equals yes I'll have someone else it so uh let's see if you guys got it so if we say that all the emo people are vampires and all the non-o people are not vampires what do we get wrong 1679 1679 that's exactly right and fast good we get 167 and N wrong one six and seven are wrong cuz they are not emo but their vampire's nine is wrong because Squall is emo and he's not a vampire good okay what if we said that EX exactly the transforming characters are vampires and the ones that do not transform are not vampires which ones we get wrong trans is the next one over all of the on so which on would we get wrong if we said that transforms yes we're vampires and transforms no we're not vampires we get wrong we definitely get eight wrong because she's not aamp oh no but it's it's on the it's actually on there yeah y yes exactly oh yeah oh man you you didn't see the chart you were just like H you you saw on the left you're just like hm which of these are transforming characters okay that's pretty hardcore but yeah 3 four five and8 no no it's definitely given to you that would be like the worst test ever for for international students uh if you don't know these 10 characters that Mark found as vampires you lose all right so what about that sparkly equals yes is a vampire and if it's not sparkly it's not a vampire this is not this is guaranteed not to go well what do you think is going to get wrong Spar yeah Sparkle equal yes are the only vampires get wrong be yep MH five yep and eight yes that's right it gets 1 2 4 5 6 78 that's pretty awful but damn it it gets Edward Colin right and he's hard to get correct due to the fact that he's not really much like a vampire he's more of a superhero who says he's a vampire okay so next number of romantic interests greater than two so if they have more than two romantic interests they're a vampire and otherwise they're not a vampire so which ones would those get wrong would that get wrong H three and 10 just three and 10 that's right because CI had Odus she had telemus actually she had that guy she turned into a woodpecker she had that other guy who was a sea god who caused her to turn Sila into the ninee headed thing and probably at least one other person so seriously it gets wrong and it also gets Edward cullin wrong because he only has one so three and 10 you can tell I thought about this problem when I was writing it up I wrote this one all right number of romantic interests greater than four so it's a little bit different this time now you have to have at least four romantic interests um or actually greater than four but there are none there exactly four to be classified as a vampire which ones do you think is going to get wrong three four yep it is going to get three four and 10 wrong cuz now you run into the fact that SAA has that blonde chal guy and Kai so um the last of the positive ones because I Pro I claim I can derive all the negative ones if you guys give me the positive ones last of the positive ones is everybody's a vampire who does that get wrong yes okay now I can derive all the negative ones from this without a sweat evil equals no well it's 1 6 7 8 9 10 without looking at the chart raise your hand if you don't see why uh raise your hand if you see why it's 1 16 7 8 9 10 without looking at the chart raise your hand if you don't nobody okay wait one hand okay I saw another one back there too later they were just more tentative okay it's the complement of a because a is evil equals yes is a vampire it gets 2 3 4 and five wrong so therefore evil equals no is a vampire is going to guaranteed to get all the opposite ones oh you could have looked at that yeah we're looking here but we're not looking at the big chart there you can look oh yeah if you can't look at anything then you're screwed unless you've ALS not only are you as hardcore as this guy but you've also memorized the numbers uh all right so emo equals no is going to be 2 3 4 5 8 10 transforms equals no is one two 6 7 9 10 Sparkle equals no is 3 9 10 where metic interest less than two is everything except three and 10 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 and then finally everything eight N9 and 10 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all right so we've started off we know what everything gets wrong I then make a bold claim because there is there are n of these which is 14 I make the claim that there are only six that in your wildest dreams you would ever possibly even consider using ever and the rest you would never ever use uh question yeah I just have a question about the number romantic interest yes you negated it without an equals on either side that's true uh that works only because there are none that are two or four but it should have been negated with a less than or equal I'm copying off of the quiz but yes I noticed that this morning when I was um putting myself through my P I'm like there's not less than equal to wait a minute and then oh wait it doesn't have any twos or fours actually I don't remember writing them all as fives and threes it's possible that somebody else in the post editing process changed them all to be about the same number and then change the less than or equal to to be less confusing it's possible I had serc at four and there was an equal to somewhere and they were like forget it CU I can't think of the fifth romantic interest for her so yes normally you would have to negate it with a equal to sign but there happen to not be any things that are equal to four or two here so they get away with it this time but good practice it's good practice so I'm claiming that our West dreams we only ever want to use six of these ever and the other eight forget it so let's see I will call on people at random to um the first people obviously getting it really easy to tell me which of these you think that you might ever want to use give me one you might ever want to use y of course the best one yes that's one that you might ever want to use I'll Circle the ones that you might ever want to use e it only gets three and 10 wrong that's amazing it's like the best classifier of all okay so give me another one that you might ever want to use f let's see f f is great it only gets three wrong do people agree that you would ever want to use f everyone's saying no why not it's like e except worse it's guaranteed at every step no matter what the weights are to have a worse accuracy than e it is definitely good if e wasn't around it would be one of our best classifiers of all but actually f is not one of the six this is why I wrote had them write on the test that there are six because people might not have found all six because people who did figure out not to include F might not have figured out to include some of the ones you want to include so I don't understand why you can't use f okay so we start off with oneth weight for all of our data points but let's say during our time of boosting that all 10 of the data points have now different weights so we'll call whatever the weight of three is which you're going to get wrong you want to minimize the error right so the weight of three which goes into the error of e is X the weight of 10 can be y so if you get if you're thinking of choosing three you know your or sorry if you're thinking of choosing e your error is X Plus y if you're thinking of choosing F your error is X Plus y plus Z which Z is the error of four and since you never going to have a negative weight X Plus y plus Z is always greater than x plus y that's a yes you would you would probably choose something without the three and the 10 uh that didn't get the three and the 10 wrong but you would certainly never choose F ever because it's always worse than e in fact this is exactly the process that will allow you to find the correct six and by I will I mean Ken and by Ken I mean let's see if you guys get it give me another one of the six that you might keep k k is the claim sparkly okay K I'm going to say will lose for the same reason as F it's 39 and 10 um it's essentially similar to 34 and 10 so oh by the way we should not be only going for the ones with the fewest wrong with the fewest incorrect where you need to be going for ones that do not have something that is strictly better in this case three and 10 wrong is strictly better than getting three n and 10 wrong question I was going to say transform you going to say transformed you going to be correct transforms is one of the ones we need see 3 four 5 and 8 there's nothing down here that gets fewer than those wrong like there's nothing that gets US 34 five wrong for instance there's no yeah there's no way to get 3 four wrong without without getting either 10 wrong or five and eight wrong what not g why not g why not why not g let's include G2 we need six no I just said give me any and someone gave me the easiest one e question why not b b looks great I love B let's include B does someone else want to give another one that they want to include a why not a sure I it's hard to see down here cuz there might be something better on the bottom but yeah there's not so let's include a why not a I love a a is great okay so that is now that is now five there's one more that we need is by far the hardest one to find find me one more that there's nothing better than it there's nothing that has a strict subset of the same ones wrong what why would you choose a if CH C okay why would you choose a if you already chos C let's say eight was a real problem for you and you were just getting let's say that three four and five they weren't that bad they weren't that bad they weren't that bad okay you got them wrong here with transforms you chose to see but sometime later eight was just by far your issue all right 3 four and five and eight 3 four and five were much smaller weights than eight and then after you got them you got 3 four five and eight wrong 3 four and five were still not that bad and eight you still was a high number and then sometime later down the line you're looking at things and you're saying you know what I really don't want to get eight wrong again but I I don't mind if I get three four and five wrong maybe I'll get it wrong with two which I've never gotten wrong yet actually none of the ones we've circled here get two wrong so it's probably not that bad to get two wrong so that that's why because it also it doesn't get eight wrong if a was 2 3 4 58 you would never take it you see what I mean oh did someone raise their hand did someone find it I just a question you can use the same reasoning for for choosing K right because like when we chose after e we could have chosen a and said that n is like only a little different but it's strictly worse sorry sorry I me like like and 10 and then we could have chosen 3 n and 10 right because but we should always choose because 3 10 is getting only 310 wrong is better than getting 39 and 10 wrong any Universe you pick you see what I mean it might not be that much worse it might be only a little bit worse to choose K but it's always worse so question I don't know if I one by reasoning be we need one that doesn't have three in it okay right now half of three five our guys get okay that's a pretty what are you thinking about that I'm trying to justify D you're trying to justify d d is huge it gets more than half of them wrong but you know what it gets three right you know what it gets 10 right and unlike our other things it get three and 10 right which is which is B also gets nine right d is the last classifier you got it is hard to choose one that has seven of them wrong but D is the last one you might pick there's it turns out there's nothing better than this for classifying correctly those annoying data points of Edward cin and Squall and also seriously who's not that annoying but she tends to be a problem when romance is concerned so um these are the six that we might use we can now ignore the rest of them forever or at least until someone reuses this problem or something like that but we can ignore everything except ABC D EEG in fact why did I even bring that up all the ones we want are on the front I'll bring it back down then I'll cross this off with Reckless abandon that even broke off a b my chalk now these are the ones we're actually thinking about using there's a chart over here already prepared to do some boosting with these six classifiers all right so let's give it a try now remember in boosting we always try to choose whichever classifier is the least error is there a question sorry yeah before we move on can you say Yes again like a little more slowly what exactly we were looking for when we were choosing our like something about the substance you want to take every classifier you you generally want to take classifiers so I'll tell you what lets you cross off a classifier that may be a better way to do it you can cross off a classifier as useless if um if and by the way this is only useful if you can do it faster than just wasting your time looking at all of them because if you can't class cross off some of them as useless usually on the test they won't make you you can just waste your time and have 14 instead of six possibilities every step of the boosting but take a look at this one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 then see do you have anything here that has a strict subset of these wrong oh look 2 3 4 5 is a strict subset this can be crossed off 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 anything that's a strict subset yes 1 1679 so it can be crossed off 1 2 4 5 6 7 89 um let's see 1 679 is a strict subset 3 91 310 is a strict subset 1 1679 is strict subset 3 uh 458 is a strict subset as is 2 3 45 1 1679 is a strict subset and up here 3 410 310 is a strict subset but the others don't have one even 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 so you look in general you want to keep them you want to keep every classifier you might use the only ones you'll never use are ones that there's something else is just better Always by having a strict subset of them wrong hopefully that was more clear it's a It's Tricky some U very few people realized were brave enough to take sparkly even when it got seven things wrong so let's start out some boosting this wasn't boosting this was setting yourself up that it was setting yourself up with the knowledge of how boosting works less knowledge less search now we only have to search six things ah I mean more knowledge less search not L knowledge less search so we start off with all weights being equal and since there's 10 data points all 10 of the data points are weighted one10 okay we're now waiting all of them equally since we're waiting all of them equally when we want to find the classifier that gets the least error we just want to find the one that gets the fewest points wrong which one is that that's our friend e the first one that people realized was a good one so we're going to choose classifier e what's our error it's just the sum of the ones we get wrong so what's our error this time it's 1 we got points 3 and 10 wrong they both have a weight of 1/10th 1/10th + 11/1 is 1/5 so I'll put 1/5 and alpha alpha is sort of a vote that will be used at the very end to sort of aggregate our classifier Alpha is 1/2 natural log of 1 minus the error over the error however I have a little trick for you it's not that impressive of a trick but it's a little fun so since error is one oh sorry not error alpha alpha is one half natural log of 1 minus error over error if error is in the form if error is 1 /x then Alpha is 12 natural log of x - one that just follows from the math it's a little shortcut if error is in the form of 1 /x then it's just one have natural log of x - one which means since this is in the form of 1/5 everyone Alpha is 12 ln4 okay 1 half L and four so now we come to the part in boosting that many people consider to be the hardest part and I'm going to show you how to do it more easily this is that part where we try to make all the ones we got right we changed their weights to be 1/2 and all the ones we got wrong we changed their weights to be 1 and half here is my automated process it's called the numerator stays the same method here's how it works here's our 10 data points their current weight is 1/10th all of them we're about to reweight them for the next step so you agree they're all one1 they're equal to start off so step one erase the denominators screw fractions I don't like them there's division multiplication it's a pain I just want to add whole numbers that's what we're going to do so which ones do we get wrong three and 10 Circle those all right add the numbers in the circles and multiply by two what does that give you four that's the new denominator you always multiply by two add the numbers not in the circles multiply by two what is that give you 16 that's the new denominator the final crucial step so that we can do this again next round is by far the most mathematically complicated thing here because we have to actually do something with fractions but it's not too bad is we then change everything to be with the same denominator so the 1/4s become 416 all right I can also UNC Circle these for next ah I hit the the that button all right all right new weights 116th 116th 416 116th 116th 116th 116th 116th 416 note the weights at up to one the ones you got wrong add up to one2 the ones you got right add up to one2 you're happy so now that you get 416 of an error for getting three wrong 416 of an error for getting 10 wrong take a look at these six I'm not going to call on someone just whoever's good at not whoever's good at math and can add these up more quickly just three and 10 count as four all the other count as one add them up tell me which one's the latest what did you say go B you go with B it doesn't get three wrong that sounds pretty good to me does everyone else like b as well I like it I mean of our ones that don't get three wrong or 10 wrong we're only looking at B and D and D just has D has seven B has four so B is the best b gets 416 wrong does everyone see that cuz even getting one of three or 10 wrong is as bad as all the ones that b gets wrong because of the new weights so cool let's choose B that's right and I sort of gave it away what's the error that B has it has four of the four wrong Each of which are worth 11/6 the error is what 416 or 1/4 whichever is your favorite which means that the alpha is 12 L and three Bingo final round okay we what did we get wrong we got 1 six 7 and n WR oh yeah we can erase the denominators all right what are the numbers in the circles summed up multipli by two that's 8 1/8 and what about the numbers not in the circle summed up multip by two that's right 24 which means I'm going to have to change all the numbers in the circle to 324 except I guess I don't because this is the last round but if I was going to do another round let's prepare in case we were change all these to 324s besides it makes it easier to calculate which one is the best classifier because you can just use the numerators and and sort of add them up so while I'm writing that up you guys figure out which one you like for classifier and call it out to me when I'm done 324th 1 124th 424th 1 124th 324th 124th 324th wait I'm off by one here 314 aha you're right W1 is not assigned to any anything so w W2 is really W1 um yeah yes that's true okay well you get it h so what is the best H you get it because it's right here see the process is so foolproof even a fool like me can get it right while they have the chart wrong all right so what's the best classifier you say C I say that seems pretty reasonable it only gets three four five and eight wrong does anyone else get a different answer someone else gets a I like a who said a a lot of people said a well let's figure it out so a a gets 1 5 6 7 C gets 45 6 7 they're in fact equal tie break goes to the lower letter because that's what we said in fact I didn't tell you but that's what we said question so we deciding which class are to use mhm do we only look at the weights or do we also look at the the round ignore all the previous rounds the question is do you only look at the current weights when determining the classifier or do you look at the previous rounds as well you got to ignore the previous rounds trust me they will be used later in the vote but it's sort of like tainting the jury a little bit to use the previous rounds um when you're doing the current round because you want to start fresh with these new weights get a new class classifier and then later everyone will get to make their vote so you only do it based on the current weights don't no although the way it's taken into consideration is when it's wrong it's going to increase question could you theoretically reuse a classifier question is could you theoretically reuse a classifier answer you absolutely can when that happens it essentially gets extra weight because you used it again but you can never ever use it twice in a row here's why let's say that we wanted to use um which was the one we used last over there b let's say we want to use B again what does it give us 50/50 if we wanted to use B and then B 3 6 9 12 wrong always guaranteed to give you 50/50 which is the only is the only way that you can be sure you'll never use it in fact that's by Design you could reuse it but never not twice in a row it could be used later on down the stream and it will be used because if you do seven rounds one of them has to be reused it just gives more weight to whichever one is reused but yes a wins against um c c was a perfectly good answer as well question what a or C okay if you could reuse why didn't pick e e gets eight out of 24 wrong it's one worse than a and C that's the only reason Next Step we'll probably use a so next step we'll probably use e frankly although maybe not because we picked uh we still we got three wrong on a but NE but pretty soon we would use e again because e is pretty awesome but anyway here we use a and we said we got 724 wrong oh man we can't use my little shortcut so the answer it has to be 177th or 1 half natural log of okay so there we go now we have to ask what is the final classifier of that we created from all these things all we do is we sum up all the classifiers we chose and we multiply them times their weight Alpha so 12 ln4 * e whether or not e returns true right plus 12 L and 3 * B plus Ln 177 * a is our final classifier where e returns a plus one if it's a vampire if if e thinks it's a vampire and a minus one if e thinks it's not same for b and a all right and then we take the sign of this and I don't mean sign and cosine I mean just is it positive or negative okay so the question is now on the uh on the exam is how many of the 10 data points we get right if we use this let's give it a look see e is so we have romantic interest greater than two we have Emo yes and we have evil yes so oh my gosh logarithms they're sometimes annoying do we have to actually add them up I claim we don't here's a nice special case of having three logarithms on the board one of two things is is true either one of those three logarithms is so large that it's bigger than the other two combined in which case if that one returns a positive or A negative it's just positive or negative because that one's so big or it's not one is not that large and in which case any two can dominate the other one and so just is equivalent to a majority vote so I I I claim we never have to add them when there's only three you guys see what I mean like let's say one of them was 1/ half log of a billion and the others were 1 half log of three and 1 half log of four obviously whatever the 1/ half log of a billion says which is multiply by 1 half log of a billion is it's just going to be that and the others will be ignored however if it's not the case that one of them is larger than the other two combined then it's a simple vote between the three because any two can out vote the other one if they work together and in this case let's see 177 is not quite 3 however log of 4 is certainly not better than log of 3 plus log of 177 it's not even log of four is equal to log of two plus log of two and these are both bigger than log of two um that's rules of logs log of four equal log of two 2 squ and you can take the two out so these are not big enough that one of them is bigger than the other two combined so it's just going to be a simple vote so let's go through Dracula okay he's got tons of his little vampirates he's not emo so that gets it e gets it right he's not emo so that gets it wrong but he is evil that gets it right two out of three vote that he's a vampire correct next Angel okay while he was in a long running series he's got plenty of romantic interests so that gets it right um he is certainly emo that gets it right and even though he's not evil two out of three says he's a vampire so correct next Edward cin well Twilight here we come uh let's see he only has one romantic interest so that gets it wrong okay he's emo so that gets it right but he's not evil so two wrong so Edward's not a vampire according to our final classifier but he is so we got one of the DAT of points wrong you guys see that because two out of three of our classifiers here said that he was not a vampire all right let's see say well she has more than two romantic interests and she's emo so even though she's not evil we get it right okay let's see lat he is also has many love interests is emo and is not evil so you get it right okay Bianca is evil with many love interests uh even though she's not emo two out of three you get it right all right um Cara marala carstein is basically exactly the same as Bianca with the number of romantic interest fixed the way it is so she will always do the same thing that Bianca does it's why six and seven always travel together so we get it right Sailor Moon is supposed to be not a vampire so her number of Love interests say that she's not a vampire because she only has one the fact that she's not evil and not emo says that actually she's perfectly not a vampire they all agree and that's correct squall has only one love interest Rola and he is not evil both of which say he's not a vampire but he is emo but two out of three say he's not a vampire we get it correct and CI despite her many romantic interests which says she's might be a vampire is neither evil nor emo and is not a vampire so we got everything right except Edward Colin which perhaps says more about Stephanie Meers writing than about our boostering all right final question Wesley Winden price a fellow consultant has noticed a few correlations between some of the classifiers you used He suggests using a new set of weak classifiers consisting of a pair of your original classifiers such as the um a pair of your classifiers that are logically ended and or together for instance two of the new classifiers would be Emo equals yes or evil equals yes or sparkly equals no and transforms equals yes so you know that would cut out C moon from the transformance cloud he believes that you'll be able to classify large vampire data sets larger than this one anyway more quickly with fewer rounds of boosting using his system do you agree or disagree with Wesley explain your arguments so this was you know the tough concept question does anyone have have just an instinctual thing other than like oh man it's Wesley he must be wrong you'll probably use fewer rounds of boosting because you have more classifiers but you'll have to search through more classifiers that is a rare fullo answer very few people um realized that Wesley was partially right they either said something about him being completely wrong which was wrong or said he was completely right yes it will use fewer rounds of boosting because of the fact that you can um essentially one of the things boosting already does is sort of gets things to vote together in an end like fashion so it may it'll use approximately half the number of rounds of boosting by being able to combine into two but there's a lot of ANS and ores there's in fact n choose two where n is the number of vampires and since using half the number of rounds but taking n choose two time for each round is not last time so that's exactly correct not that many people got full credit on on that one because sometimes they were seduced by Wesley's idea or they just feel like it's Wesley he's wrong or some or just some other funny answer um any questions uh about boosting question how do you know how many rounds of boosting to do how do you know the question is how do you know how many rounds of boosting to do the answer is so on the quiz it tells you that you have three in real life you kind of you might want to just kind of keep it running until it converges that's one possibility keep it running until it converges to an answer and it doesn't do anything anymore Patrick has a little widget on the 6034 website I think that you plug down some data points and run boosting on them and you can see that eventually it converges um the boosting converges to an answer and it doesn't change the um basically the classif not the classifiers you picked of course or the weights but what converges is which ones of the your of your data set you get correct because he does his in in two- dimensional space rather than like this and he shows you the lines the boosting is drawing between classification and colors things in green and red or something like that and eventually converges where the lines are and which ones is getting right it generally converges to getting everything correct um and when that happens then you can stop but that's a good question and it's not always that easy in the real world you have to sometimes just say this is enough for me I've given it a number of rounds and that's much more than the number of classifiers so maybe it won't get anything better
