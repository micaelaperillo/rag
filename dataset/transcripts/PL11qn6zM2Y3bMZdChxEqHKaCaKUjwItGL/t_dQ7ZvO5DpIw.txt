here thank you Sam uh so when I looked through the syllabus of this class and thought about what uh I could possibly add that would be useful in addition to the VAR skills one of the things that I've been thinking about has been how do you think about yourself as a Founder how do you think about what the skill set is and what are the things that you should be thinking about in terms of am I ready how do I get ready is it the right thing for me these sorts of things so let's start with the perception of what a great founder is and classically you know this tends to be Steve Jobs Bill Gates Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg Jeff Bezos and it's an image of founder as Superwoman or Superman right who is has this like panopticon of skills and I can use the word panopticon because I'm here at Stanford um but uh the it's it's things like I know how to do product Market fit I'm great at product I'm great at strategy I'm great at management I can fund raise right I can do all of these different skills and part of what you're looking for in a great founder in the kind of theory of the founder as superperson is I'm looking for someone who is awesome at all these things they they are they are well-rounded they are diverse they can bat on all skills and uh you know part of how I found this kind of emphasized in my own the beginning of my own entrepreneurial journey is I remember reading an article that said you know Bill Gates who is smarter than Einstein right and you're like well look Bill Gates is really smart and is very accomplished but I'm not quite sure smarter than Einstein is actually afras that even bill would want to be actually next to uh and it's partially because I think it's this image of founder as superperson which is that a great founder is someone who can do anything you know jump over tall tall buildings in a single bound you know all of these sorts of things and the reality right is a Founder is someone who deals with a ton of different headaches and um and no one is universally superpowered uh generally speaking you hope to have a couple of superpowers some things that are unique Edge to you some things that are unique to the problem that you're trying to solve uh some things that uh may help you give an edge because actually competitive differentiation and Competitive Edge is super important but uh but it's not uh it's not actually in fact a a function of of genius and matter of fact uh frequently it's very hard to tell the difference between Madness and genius because uh usually it's the results that play out and sometimes when you're dealing with uncertain environments you may even be genius and later be thought to be a a mad person or you may be a mad person and you turn out to be lucky and you're later thought to be a genius so it's it's actually kind of a challenging set of like how do you think about you know these sets you know what is the whole set of skills and when us mere mortals you know come into this kind of battle what is is the way right way to think about it and so um you know when I thought about this question of how is one a great founder you know part of what you get to is oh and actually this is probably the slide that for um people on uh this this may have been a suboptimal choice for people on video but it's like these are all skills that are super important right these are all things that you say well okay this is this is really really important to do and you must in fact actually do this well and it begins to look like a superhuman task and so what I did is I decided to take a a subset of these uh and focus on some of the the interesting things to think about what is it that actually makes a great founder because it's actually not that you score 10 out of 10 on all these you know the the entrepreneurial Olympiad right you you are actually the best at all of these things so let's start with team so one way to kind of I think talk about exploding the kind of the myth of the super founder is that actually in fact usually it's best to have two or three people on a team rather than a solar founder it's not that to say solar Founders don't actually play out and they can uh successfully but most often two or three people is actually in fact a much better when I look at these things as an investor and I say you know uh what is a good composition of a project and a and Founders that are likely to succeed it's usually there's two or three of them and the reasons are because for example we've already talked about the fact that there's this very broad set of skills there's this whole set of question about how you adapt your company in order to be successful and uh if you actually have two or three founders you have you have different skills you can compensate Because by the way everyone has weaknesses you can compensate for each other's weaknesses um you can uh in the diversity of problems that you encounter uh as a Founder that you can actually attack them so one of the things that I I suggest when you when you look at essentially a founding team is to have a real high preference for having co-founders having a high degree of trust for those co-founders because one of the things by the way part of the whole entrepreneurial thing is there's lots of ways to die one of the ways to die is you get a year down the road with your co-founders and then you're going through a messy divorce right and that's a that's a that that is uh not always but frequently fatal and so um and then also the divers of kind of tasks that you're trying to do and actually okay yes I was about to say that will be suboptimal from a Viewpoint of being able to look at the slides um the next thing is location uh and so frequently I've heard told to me it's like oh Silicon Valley Aggregates all of this uh super Talent which it does uh in terms of like what what actually in fact it's it's the reason why Silicon Valley uh startups are so successful is because all of these great people immigration which is hugely important for for Talon and Founders and else you know immigrate here and that's part of the reason now it's actually if you think about it from basic math even if you take something that that Silicon Valley is super strong at which is essentially software uh skills in the last uh two decades not all of the great software people move here not all of them can move here there are many of them in various other parts of the world and and so why do I put choice of location as one of the things that comes down to thinking about whether or not you're a great founder well the reason is is because what great Founders do is seek the networks that will be essential to their problem and their task and they realize that it isn't just about like kind of like I am super person I can do this anywhere I can do this you know in you know the Antarctic Etc is in order to be successful I have to go to where the strongest networks are for the particular kind of problem or the particular kind of thing that I'm doing and Silicon Valley by the way is super good at some uh kind of tasks some places that you essentially try to uh solve certain kinds of problems but is not good at all of them let me take you know kind of two examples so one is Groupon I don't think Groupon could have ever been founded here even though it's a software product it actually even generates a network which you know obviously a lot of the great Networks are here and uh and uses a um uh kind of Internet Technologies a mobile product and everything else all of which we have a lot of great skills here in silon Valley and the networks are really good for this one of the things that's Central for Groupon for its early days was having massive sales forces and massive Salesforce strengths and weaknesses of networks tend to go together Silicon Valley tends to be pretty adverse to plans that involve like oh we're gonna uh rent a 25-story building and in 20 of those stories we're going to have floors of salespeople and that's how we're going to get our thing going that kind of plan here tends to not get a lot of interest tends to get a lot of criticism tends to not have talent aggregate to it tends to have financiers talk about things like Capital efficiency and network effects and other kinds of things that are that are key here and so it's actually not a surprise that actually in fact Groupon requireed was required to be actually in Chicago which is really good at this as a way of actually kind of getting going and and showing that even software startups can be in other places but even if you begin to think about it you say okay well what kinds of of of you know other kinds of startups would someone be an idiot to move here to do think if someone were doing a fashion startup not fashion allop parm Mark which is you know a mobile you know Marketplace Etc which are a bunch of things that are good here but like I'm designing a new fashion company and I'm going to come to Silicon Valley to do it that's actually not such a great idea right the fashion company might be a great idea but you want the networks that support what you're doing and so part of the reason why where should I locate my startup is a test for thinking about uh am I a great founder is because part of what happens when you're actually founding a company is you are going I will go to where it's successful this to do to to to be because the metaphor that I frequently use for entrepreneurship is jumping off a cliff and assembling an airplane on the way down and the reason is because it's hard it has a quasi mortal exit by which you're default dead and so you're taking every possible chance to actually win and so great Founders go look I'll move to what the network is and that network is you know this graphic is frequently Silicon Valley but for for Tech startups for mobile for networks for marketplaces you know this is a really good place to do it for a bunch of other things you should think about whether or not it's a different location now here's something that you know it's very invogue all right very conventional to say you're contrarian these days um and so let's talk a little bit about what contrarian actually in fact is um so it's actually pretty easy to be contrarian it's hard to be contrarian and right and in particular when you're thinking about is my idea contrarian or contrarian enough it's how does a smart person actually disagree with me right is cuz if you can't think of a smart person person who isn't like ignorant or just crazy or something else but as a smart person who is somewhat expert in this thinks that your idea has some serious challenges then it actually isn't contrarian right so contr and contrarian is also is always actually this is one of the things that Sam and I talked about at startup school is contrarian is actually relative to an audience right so when you want to be when you're when you're thinking about contrarian in terms of like a really good contran idea is like okay what would other say it's consumer internet good consumer or internet people think is actually in fact not yet a good idea and part of when you think about contrarian is to say okay what's the way that uh what do I know that other people don't know because it isn't just a oh I'm brilliant and other people aren't and that's the reason why contrarian thing is right that's a very bad test might it happen to be true of course lightning could also strike you in the field right you know so think a lot about like what is it that I know other people don't know so for example in the very early days of LinkedIn part of what I advise uh all founders to do is go talk to every smart person who will talk to you and give you feedback so at LinkedIn I walked around and said here's my idea what do you think 2third or more of my network including some of the very very smart people all thought I was nuts and the reason why I thought I was nuts was because they said well look it's a network product it's only valuable with a bunch of people in it first person no value invitees second person second person first person it no value for either of them they already know each other when do you when do you actually begin to deliver on your use cas case which is like 500k to a million people right and so you're never going to get to size it's never going to grow now what I knew that the critiques the critics didn't know was that I could think of a set of different ways by which people say look it's pretty easy to say look I believe in the vision of this or I think it's interesting or I think a product like this should exist or I'm willing to play around with it and I can you leverage those sets of interests to grow the network to get to enough size that you could begin to deliver on the value propositions in which LinkedIn had and that was the specific thing that I knew that the critics weren't thinking about and so when you think about being contrarian you have to think about how is it that smart people agree with me they disagree with me from a position of intelligence right and there's something that I know that they don't know that actually in fact will play out to be true now in this case in general as a as a Founder it's good to be contrarian in the real sense and right now the other last part on contrarian is to think about there's lots of different ways to be contrarian so for example a frequent one will be is like oh yeah that's a good small idea but actually no it's not small it's large or you know actually in fact uh you can assemble the talent or While most consumer internet uh startups tend to be like for example there's another LinkedIn example tend to be uh only successful with their rocket ships actually a gradual compounding curve can actually be very very valuable LinkedIn never had its rocket ship moment it was It was kind of compound yearby year but that in the consumer internet tends to be a uh atypical to the pattern so here you begin to get to a bunch of sorts of problems that um essentially Founders run into which is like well should I be doing the work or should I be recruiting people and delegating the work and classically the answer to this is actually in fact you need to do both right and uh in fact uh not only do you need to do both you need to do sometimes one at 100% and sometimes the other one at 100% and sometimes even though this is not so good at math both at 100% And so uh what you'll see is this is actually classic when you begin thinking about what is a great founder is you navigate what is apparent paradoxes so another one that I frequently talk about is you got to be both flexible and persistent and the reason for this is entrepreneurs are frequently given the advice to you know have a vision stay firm against adversity you know realize that you you have this Vision that is contrarian to what other people think and just stay on track get through the difficult times and get there the other piece of advice given with equal Vigor is uh listen to data listen to customers uh pivot be flexible right part of the thing that this comes out to being in terms of being a great founder is to say Well when should I be persistent when should I be flexible and the the vehicle that I most often use for this is you should have on a project you're doing like a company an investment thesis that essentially says why you think possibly contrarian why you think this is potentially a good idea it should include what you know that you think other people don't know and then as you're going into the battlefield you go is you know am I in fact increasing confidence in my investment thesis or decreasing confidence in my investment thesis because if I'm increasing confidence then oh stay on track you know be persistent and by the way sometimes even with adversity your confidence can can increase if it's decreasing that doesn't mean jump out uh PayPal LinkedIn uh Airbnb a whole bunch of startups I've in up I've been part of have had months where you were like oh my God this why did we ever think this was a good idea it's kind of a valley of the Shadows moment so like example in PayPal it was you know August 2000 we were burning $12 million in one month the expense curve was exponentiating we had no Revenue decrease in confidence however we say okay what do we do in order to fix that and that gives you your immediate action plan another one is should you have belief or should you have fear right should you have you know you should you essentially go well no no I I have this vision of the way the world should be and I should ignore everything else and I should just go at that well again part of what being a great founder is is being both able to hold the belief to think about where it is you want to be doing and where want to be going but also be smart enough that you're essentially listening to criticism uh negative feedback uh competitive entries where you're kind of going okay is this changing my investment thesis is this changing what I'm planning on doing it doesn't mean you lose confidence you have the confidence but you also essentially have the Peril again in this kind of thing of how do you put these two things together should I focus internally build the product ignore the world ignore competitor Etc or should I focus externally should I be recruiting should I be meeting people should I be gathering Network intelligence again the answer is both and the reason why I'm focusing on these kind of it's It's both rather than either or is because part of what makes a great founder is the ability to to to be flexible across these lines to sometimes be 90% one way sometimes be 80% the other way be executing the judgment on what does the current problem look like how is it that when I'm trying to solve this that I should say this is what we should be doing and how should I be dividing the work and part of when you think about these things and you say like this is another one that's kind of classic is people say well I'm completely motivated by data it's what customers say to user groups you know I've uh a lot of entrepreneurial methodologies lean other kinds of things are talked about is like gather the data be guided on the data well actually in fact data only exists within the framework of a vision that you're building to a hypothesis of where you're moving to and the data can even be negative and you can think well actually in fact this negative data means that I need to change or alter the way that I'm thinking about something but I actually keep on a specific Vision about what I'm doing and and by the way sometimes even when you have that specific Vision you don't necessarily actually ever end up at that big Vision that you were thinking about so for example you know at PayPal we distributed these t-shirts that said uh the new Global uh world currency right well actually in fact one of the the and I know Peter's been here um one of the jokes I told Peter is like well actually we do have this new world Global Currency what we're trading in is dollars you may have heard of it it's existed for a while right where essentially a master Merchant for that um now of course this presses what might be happening with Bitcoin although you know there's the whole another topic there however the key thing is is that vision of saying we are creating a kind of a universal Network that allows anyone to to pay anyone to become a merchant to bring the electronics into the speed of Commerce at any business that that is being transacted that Vision kept to True North by we say well first we think we're going to have a banking model then we think we're going to have you know um a a a debt model oh no we're actually have a master Merchant model and how does that actually play out so you're always combining the vision and the data and the data is within the framework of of a vision and sometimes of course the what you learn changes your vision now this is one of the ones that I actually think we we we we save this special picture for one of the ones that I actually think is quite key is that normally entrepreneurs uh Founders are thought about as having like they're Risk Takers right they're they're they they they whereas everyone else cowards in fear from this notion of risk they boldly go out now that's true you have to be a risk taker you have to be thinking about how do I make a really coherent bet on risk because in fact the only really big opportunities the only contrarian opportunities smart people disagree with you on happen to be one that have risks associated with them on the other hand part of the skill set that when you're beginning to apply how you think about risks as an entrepreneur is you're beginning to think about like how do I take intelligent risks how do I take a focused risk that if I'm right about that one thing right then a bunch of other things break my way and once I start doing that I try to figure out how to make my my onshot possibility as high as possible EG how do I minimize other risks how do I essentially take this risk in an intelligent way that doesn't just go oh yeah risk risk to the win who cares right let's go and so this kind of combines that you know this image which I think is the best of the of the of the images we found for this yet is kind of the sense of how to think about it now back to what I was uh saying in terms of uh having an investment thesis part of having an investment thesis is you chart it out it's kind of the list of bullets you say like for example in early LinkedIn it was like look uh everyone is actually going to be benefited by public Professional Network everyone will realize including companies that it's better to have it uh uh play out this way uh the initial set of adoption will come from uh essentially people who are like visualize the role this way are willing to play with it and then eventually the mass Market will come on as they begin to have a network that is already delivering a value proposition to them that's what kind of an investment thesis can look like and then you know you got economics so like initially recruiting and then and then broadening other things you have that investment thesis and you say is my investment thesis increasing or decreasing in confidence do I think that the data that I get from the market when I talk to smart people how does that how does that change my confidence in it and this is actually how you essentially minimize risk so for example very early very early days in PayPal um the part of what happened is they said okay well we're going to do cash on mobile phones we'll cash on Palm Pilots because it's really easy we actually realized the cash on Palm Pilots wouldn't work even before we launched the product because basically what happened is I went in and said to Max and Peter I said look here's our challenge our challenge is we're uh this room probably doesn't remember what PA and Pilots are um they were like like early pdas um and so uh we lived in where what was Palm Pilot Central and the whole use case was splitting the dinner Tab and how many people if everyone at the table would have a Palm Pilot spiter dinner tab zero to one in every single restaurant so you could even just by thinking it through you realize like the direction you're on is going to hit a Minefield and you need to Pivot and that's when Max Leon came up with the idea saying actually in fact we could sync by emails we could have email payments as the backbone of this and we're like oh that's a good idea and of course that's what the whole thing kind of pivoted into and that's part of thinking through minimizing the risks as you're actually executing here's another one that's kind of classic which is well should I have this long-term Vision or should I be solving local near-term problems and again the answer is both it's these paradoxes and the question is is you jump between them you should always have a long-term vision in mind because if you actually completely lose your your directions eventually you'll find yourself in some field there's not a good path out of but if you're not focused on solving the problem that's immediately in front of you you're hosed right and so um part of the uh the question about how you put these things together is you say Okay short term what's the thing I need to be doing today have I made today have made progress this week but is it largely on path so I'll give you an example of how this plays out in terms of financing or in terms of strategy so people frequently think product strategy is fundamental to how um uh startups like I have a product idea that's the thing I'm a Founder actually in fact the next level down on strategy is usually product distribution whether it's consumer internet or um uh or Enterprise or anything else because actually in fact no matter how good your product is if it doesn't get to customers your host osed so usually you have to have product distribution is more fundamental than the actual what the product is and the one below it is financing and the reason why it's financing is if you run out of money and the whole effort goes away even if you have a really good idea it doesn't work so frequently when you're executing on a good strategy you're actually in fact when I'm raising money this Fund Raising I'm thinking about the next fundraising I'm thinking about how I'm set up for it I'm establishing relationships that would be key to that and I'm I'm not executing like oh the only thing that matters is I get to the next is is get to the next fundraising because you have this business that you're building but I'm thinking that as a core strategy in terms of how I'm executing and frequently you're thinking about okay how does my product distribution work such that the financing works well and that's kind of how you architect these things together so how do you know if you might be a great founder well it's you should have some superpowers it's generally speaking in software useful to be a good product person it's useful to have good skills about kind of leadership of bringing networks in of persuading people and it's useful to um be able to and this is kind of the most fundamental is recognize whether or not you're on track or not to have both that kind of uh belief but also paranoia about am I tracking against my investment thesis and when you do that the right way and you're learning and you're assembling people and you're assembling networks around you that's generally speaking how you end up being a great founder now classically and and I deliberately put up five white man male pictures is classically you have a kind of a these are the ICONic Founders but in fact Founders can be very diverse they can be extraordinarily uh talented in different areas because there's different kinds of entrepreneurial companies there's different kinds of problems that they're trying to solve and I don't just mean diversity in terms of classic you know kind of gender race Etc I diversity in age age diversity and experience you know Jack ma was a a was a a teacher before he got into this that's the kind of thing that you can that you should think about and so the the question is is how you cross uneven ground how you assemble networks around you how you get people to assemble this that it's a constantly changing problem to face when you are trying to found a company and so um I think the the thing that I was trying to get people to think about with this is to say there's not one skill set there's an ability to learn and adapt an ability to constantly have a vision that's driving you but to be taking input from all sources uh and then to be uh creating networks around you and that's essentially what makes a great founder and your ability to do that while crossing uneven ground in a fog which is kind of the the the the way that entrepreneurs cuz you don't really know like did you always know this is going to work no unless you're crazy right uh although sometimes crazy Works um so with that I will now go to a few questions um but it was kind of this mindset of Founders which is kind of key and if there's no question oh here I'm curious about how in LinkedIn how you um you targeted the early or that you selected and came up with a strategy for getting the right early ad dos that you knew would strengthen your investment thesis and really help it take off it seems like every startup faces that yep that same challenge so one of the really fundamental things is to is to think about product distribution is key and for LinkedIn we had a couple things going for us so one the web was boring in 2003 um that basically what happened is everyone had thought the consumer net was over and so people were doing clean tech and Enterprise software and everything else that's a much harder problem now because everyone thinks the Internet and mobile is interesting and so breaking through the noise is really key so the strategy we wouldn't work we just actually set up sent out some invitations to a group of people and then tuned the mechanism to have and did PR to get people like one of the decisions we made early that was right was to say should we only allow it as invite only or should we allow cold signups the reason we should allow cold signups is because the people who are super enthusiastic about this weren't necessarily the people we know so they would sign up and spread it that sort of thing where all the kind of decisions we made now that challenge is much harder because the challenge when you think about product distribution is is how are you competing for potential customers or potential members time and what do they think what do they have to believe in back in 2003 it was like well a professional Network that's potentially a good idea what the hell I'll play with it there's not a lot of other things for me to look at today there's tons of things and so your strategy today when you're looking at product distribution has to be what is my really decisive Edge what is the hack that I know that other people don't know when someone come to you how he tell you know his a good found another from like a half hour p um so how do I know if someone's a good founder or not um well it's not uh I'm a huge believer in references um usually I only ever actually no 100% of the time in this case I only meet with someone when they come to me through a reference so one of the things by the way is I thing is I after this I have to run off because I have a meeting that I need to get to if you want to actually get time and attention with you find a reference that's not a pitch to using LinkedIn it's a question of this is how you sort out time you can find like Sam knows me not to throw Sam under the bus right yes um and so uh a reference to me is uh in fact the way that I do this and so for example when I met with the aab BNB guys uh part of the reason why I could interrupt them two minutes into their pitch and say I'm going to make you an offer to invest I want to hear the rest of the pitch because I think what you're doing here is is uh is magical and awesome was because I'd already had references on them like that was only 2 minutes not even 30 minutes because I already knew about them before coming in and by the way by and large that's some version that is true of most of the great investors and it's that it's that uh Network that's really key I think there was a question over here too here so would you consider density of insight to be a strong signal for great Founders density of insight is a strong signal for great Founders can you say another sentence so so being able to distill a thesis out of a whole variety of observations so they look down to a concise sentence well I would definitely say that the ability to say coherently what you're targeting and to articulate something that isn't trying to boil the ocean or a Swiss army knife approach but it's like one Focus like look if we're right about this then it works that is actually pretty important to be to being able to judge a Founder because if you don't have that level of clarity you're not going to be able to assemble the network behind you you're not going to be able to get investors you're not going to get employees you have to be able to articulate a very clear Mission about what you're doing um and insight is helpful although uh a little bit of this depends on the stage it is always if I find I find myself attracted to Founders who've analyzed the problem a good way but but frequently I've seen great Founders who do not present good analysis but have an instinct about what they're doing and so you more chart what kind of what's going on around them when Lincoln had like 5 years of like U I guess um ramp up time like what what kept you going to like keep like doubling down on the original uh so why did how did I keep persistence when because actually LinkedIn went through you know uh let's see for those who remember uh we were we were treated as the uh as the as the as the little alternative to frenster then to Myspace then to Facebook right so we had a lot of different like we are the little teeny one next to these to these respective Giants uh each of the time ultimately for me when I was thinking about LinkedIn this gets back to the investment thesis as a mechanism I continued to believe the actually in fact the right economic system designed for every individual's life and for organization's life is to have public professional profiles that that that that world is the way the world should be everyone's much better off with it and we are getting closer to that than everyone else it may be that it hasn't taken off as fast as I like it may be that the general world is going oh the social stuff is really interesting we don't like we can only get in the news in the fall in the summer of 2003 by saying we were friends to but for business which is completely like nonsensical once you begin on you know you begin to look at the thing but it was like okay we'll cover you because it's friends for but for business and that was important to begin to get people to pay attention to us and so the confidence was that world I still have confidence believe that it should exist and no one is getting closer to it than we it's taking us maybe longer than I'd hop to get there but that's okay so okay when you get it wrong when you meet a Founder that you think is going to be really good and you know seems to be able to move between these opposing forces yep and on paper seems like they're going to go the distance what is it that makes you get wrong about someone that looks good at first observation well to some degree you can only fully cross these kind of mind field by actually going and doing it right so you're can be wrong about your hypothesis the kinds of things that frequently get you wrong get get wrong are when you think that a person because they like for example one of the tests that I frequently use in an interaction is I push on the idea some and what I'm looking for is both flexibility and persistence I'm looking for no I have conviction and what I'm thinking and I'm arguing it but I'm listening to what you're saying and I'm adapting to the concerns and whatnot of what of how you think about that sometimes you'll find someone who says look I've learned to mimic that behavior so I've learned to say for example I've learned to look look like I'm reasoning with you and I look like I'm I'm thinking about the challenge you bring up but actually in fact I'm ignoring you right and ignoring me that might be fine right ignoring the world in general is usually disaster uh and so those are the kinds of things that in the measurement you can see essentially getting wrong but um but usually the kind of thing like most often like kind of reference questions I ask about Founders is like adaptability uh like one of the phrases that I frequently look for is infinite learning curve because each entrepreneurial pattern is to some degree unique and new and can you learn the new one right as way of doing it and so um like does the learning break down or is there some major skill set is there an ego issue that gets in the way like well I must be the great like everyone everyone must agulate me and that will cause you to to behave wrongly in adapting to the problem those kinds of things I think I have uh one last question the wom in the back what makes a great co-founding team and from your perspective what makes a good partnership when you're evaluating how to be a great co-founder co-founding Team how to evaluate uh and then how to think about co-founders so the first thing is it's super important that you collaborate really well that was the kind of the point I was making during the team the the the initial part of that because if you in fact don't have pretty good serious trust um uh you know kind of a way of of um it's 150 that I'm supposed to end right 205 oh 205 no no no no I'll keep going sorry I I I misread the time so I have I will have time for more questions sorry I was trying to be trying to be good the um uh so okay let me give a little bit longer answer to this then so the key thing is when you're thinking about founder Founders uh Founders is do you have a diversity of the necessary strengths across the whole range of strengths that would be useful frequently you need one technical founder uh at least uh frequently you need to have someone who is uh who is going to be dedicated to the business side fundraising these sorts of things that's kind of classically skill set when you think about the two to three and usually it's kind of some uh composition across them and that's kind of like what you think of as Founders one when you're thinking about a founding team when you um when you get the next level deep for example one of the things that people will classically tell you is like for example don't invest in a husband wife team and actually that's look that that adds a little extra uh Freight to it and everything else cuz you know the personal Dynamics also uh upset what's going on I actually think that what you're looking for is do they collaborate well do they help each other get to truth right so for example I am most heartened when I'm talking to a team that when they're when they're reasoning to each other they're not like oh we're just all singing from the same thing it's like oh but did you think about this or what about this as a challenge like you're navigating the field of battle which has a bunch of risks like for example one of the things that was pretty common in PayPal is uh Max who who invented the fraud systems and everything else would frequently come into Peter's office Peter teal Max Levin and say look here are some things that are going to kill us and let me Focus you on them right so it's not like we're all just kind of saying oh yes we're all singing our kumbayas but we are adjusting to what is truth and what's the problem we need to solve what's the problem in the short term what's the problem in the long term and how are we tackling it and that composition within a team that Collective problem solving that collective learning is the kind of thing that actually usually makes great teams yeah thank you for this wonderful lecture I recall say we all of a flying CS but we end up 140 character so I would like to ask you you know how to identify great funders in different sectors like someone might good social network like and some they working on content Computing or how to how call science or the vision to marks or those kind of things do you see any comment b or any so different Founders different areas how do you identify them so the talk was aimed at kind of what is unique about the mindset I think of Founders that is great founder across all uh all founders that's that's part of what this was at attempting to say look because there are differences so for example in software speed to Market speed to to learning is really key in Hardware if you screw it up you're dead right so accuracy really matters right cuz if you if you build and ship the wrong thing you're hosed so generally speaking as an investor uh and this is part of the reason why a lot of investors you know have a certain set of things that they then learn pretty well and try to reapply because they try to understand a domain well enough to be able to identify which are the founders in this domain that really matter and if we're investing in this domain how do we do that well um and so there are attributes that are unique per domain uh so for example uh you know like like if like one of the classic ones is how good must you be at operational efficiencies in terms of margins cost controls Etc you're dealing in the worlds of atoms including even Ecommerce You' got to be really good at that you're doing a uh a digital gaming like a like a Zinga like startup doesn't matter at all right so and and so you look for that kind of fits and proclivities and part of the beginning of this is it's not actually in fact that it's one person as good at everything I would be like one of the funniest conversations I had with with with a guy a friend of mine who worked for me at my first startup social net is he looked at me and he said Reed I would never hire you to be a manager of McDonald's I'm like yeah I wouldn't either I'd be terrible at that right and so it's it's the skill set that fits but also the the whole point of this is actually make navigating a set of things that look like paradoxes sometimes being heavy on one sometimes heavy on the other and being having the right Judgment at the moment in terms of what you're doing and that's what tends to be more Universal um you mentioned that it took you longer than you would have liked to grow you speak a little bit about uh when how to know whether or not you should stay in or when how to know when to give up um also maybe even uh with respect to like your personal and your career goals or like how it fits in that big picture so the question is basically how do you know when to Pivot um part of the reason why having investment thesis and your confidence in your investment thesis and being pretty clear on that is generally speaking the answer that I give people is if your confidence uh is unmeasured for a fairly long time or is decreasing because unmeasured for a fair long time should be decreasing and it's decreasing and then you go into intense mode where you're trying to figure out what kinds of things you would do that would increase your confidence right uh and that's failing that's a seriously good time to think about pivoting right uh and and you might have uh thesis on can we raise money you might have thesis on will what's the uh pattern by which the product distribution or growth or you know viral invitation or SEO or anything else will work and it's like well I tried these three things and this fourth thing doesn't seem as good as these three and the next two things that I think about seem even worse that begins to degrease your confidence and that's when you should think about pivoting a frequent mistake when it comes to pivoting is wait until you've essentially crashed into the wall and everything is dead and you can't make any you can't maneuver anymore and that's that's you waited way too long now um now in terms of personal career goals and so forth you know part of the thing that um I would say that is uh uh one of the things that I had meant to talk to during the slides that uh since I misre the time I I I rush through it a little bit one of the classic questions is balance and I actually think founders have no balance like one of the funniest conversations I ever had was with a governor of Colorado who's like we're going to attract really great entrepreneurs here CU we have this balanced lifestyle like like literally if I ever hear a Founder talking about oh this is how I have a balanced life and so for they're not committed to winning right and so the only really great Founders are like I am going to literally pour everything into doing this now it only may be for a couple years I may do this for a while then go do all things but while I'm doing this I am unbalanced at this thing it's not to say you don't take breaks it's not to say you don't you know go on dates or whatever else but you're super focused on this because it's really hard and there's lots of ways to die and that's the reason why the jumping off the cliff metaphor is one of the ones that I classically use so your definition ofm sorry depends on the idea of identifying UNC opportunities which others don't necessarily see uh overall how efficient do you think the startup ecosystem is at identifying a good opportunities so how good is the startup ecosystem at identifying contrarian opportunities um let's see it's kind of challenge because the moment it kind of actually becomes invogue it's less contrarian um um I'd say it's mixed uh sometimes because part of what makes a great investor is an ability to go look I take this radical shot I take this radical shot I take this radical shot and there's enough people who are investors there's usually someone if you can find your way to them the network finding your way through the network sometimes difficult sometimes tons of noise hard to get to the signal uh on the other hand there's sometimes things that are just kind of like you know totally crazy like one of the funny things was you know uh a benchmark was the only one that would fund eBay um you know if you talk to most of the people in the valley a year 18 months ago about Bitcoin they would have told you like what bit what have no idea what it is and by the way still unclear how Bitcoin will out although I think the fact that there will be a distributed trust system on cryptocurrency is I think almost certainly going to exist in the world and the real question is is Bitcoin the first or last cryptocurrency first there's new ones and new features last because it's the one that has Network effects and is already going um and so uh I think it's pretty good with it um frequently what happens is uh people think they're contrarian because they're doing something they think is in a unique com uh uh um unique uh combination I'll give you two examples and hopefully the the founders of these people who sent me these Co I get about 30 pctures sent to me a day that I don't basically don't look at unless referral unless something in the title makes me laugh in which case I look at it mostly As comedy and I'll share two comedy ones one of them was uh wearable diapers which was the you know uh you know you have the computer monitoring you know whether or not the kid is you know uh taking a pee or a poop and then let you know and you're like if you're that far away from your child and this kind of thing it's probably a bad sign of other things um and then the other one was uh kind of uh customize eCommerce bongs you're like oh I got a contrarian idea you're like yes you do but not the right way right so anyway so you know but so I think generally speaking the system is pretty good at it in the back Tri social Med um ahead of time gu um how do you think about creating markets versus creating markets versus discovering them yeah okay so uh this is actually it's a challenging question the the the the freaking like and this and it's a good follow on the contrarian thing like frequently there's this classic thing of oh does the market exist yet is that because it's going to be huge or non-existent the good news is it's usually one or the other right uh and so that makes uh going after something that most people don't think is a market but you have a reason to believe it is actually sometimes frequently a good bet um however it can it can sometimes completely uh flame out and one of the things you're doing when you're testing your investment thesis is what would lead me to think whether or not there's a market there or not because um you know at the beginning there are no markets and so it is of course conceptually possible to create markets people think that there's a a new Need for this sort of thing on the other hand the problem is is how do you get fast adoption if people don't even know that they want it as a category right so they say well but people they just realize like a classic entrepreneurial misfire a classic one is if people just real like once it exists they'll realize that they really love it and they they'll line up in droves for it well there's a few entrepreneurs Steve Jobs one of them who can do that most the time it doesn't work out that way and so you have to say uh in your investment thesis why is it that you think when you're thinking about a market that isn't already existing that that you know that other people don't know on the contrarian basis that leads you to think that market should exist right and so for example a micro one with LinkedIn was uh actually in fact the classified means of recruiting was in fact an exercise of newspapers an exercise of Information Age and actually recruiting direct to people is part of what the network age and the internet and that's actually in fact how recruiting should go now it was relatively easy to validate that but you know that's the kind of thing where you think about there's potentially a new market last question yeah last question when do you know you've known someone long enough to start accompanying from one of the things Sam told us in the first lesson was you meet someone you've known for a long time but when you guys started PayPal like for example how long did you it it was a large group of people so how do you know okay I trust these people enough to start a company so toeat I'm I'm repeating the question apart because where it is Rec recorded and everything else make sure that people hear it but the question is basically is how do you know that you trust someone well enough to be a co-founder uh there's a whole bunch of different variables to go into it and look this is one of the risks that you take uh and you kind of get to a thesis of do I think that I know them well enough uh now I I'll parallel one thing that I think um there's a parallel here that I think is super useful so one of the things I tell my portfolio company CEOs or Founders when they're thinking about hiring a CEO is um I think that the only way to do this is when you get down to the people that you're thinking you may hire as a CEO you spend 20 plus hours with them right where you go into as much depth in the conversation about anything you think is a possible difference of opinion belief workstyle so you've identified all this upfront so that you're you're you're G it's not that you have a contract it's not like oh we're signing a contract and this is how we do it but we've established the conversation we've we've gone all the parameters we've had a conversion about what we might agree with or disagree with one of the things that I frequently think is worth covering is almost like kind of the divorce like why would we want to divor like what would lead me to say this isn't working right and to cover that up front as part of it because then at that point when you get into the field of battle which is hugely stressful you go through the valley Shadows moment you've at least got the basis of we already conversed about a wide variety of things we've set up essentially some expectations about what you know how we might be playing together and if it begins to vary off that it's relatively easy to bring it up in a way that you're problem solving and that's the kind of thing that I think you frequently you should be fairly confident that you have that level of trust for me frequently it's to have a set of robust conversations such that it's like like if something comes up later it's like well we talked about this inversion and we can we can bring that up so anyway with that thank you very much thank you
