status update and then we'll go over the master solution for the online quiz that you took this week and then I think in about ten minutes we're going to have a interactive discussion with the inkosi Board of Directors and so we'll probably not get through all the master solution discussion by the time they dial in that's okay you know we'll just have a 15 20 minute chat with them the reason we're doing this is because they're at MIT right now for a three-day meeting so in cozy's the internet international council of system engineering and so we thought it would be a nice thing since you know we're this is a systems engineering class to tie in with them and hear a little bit their their perspective on what's happening in in industry and it's sort of in the bigger it in the bigger picture and hopefully some of you've got a couple questions prepared so we can have sort of a dialogue with them that's the general idea and then we have a presentation prepared the okk Tannis one project will be presented from epfl to us and I think you'll find it very exciting and so as we listen to that presentation you know put on your your system engineering thinking hat and and then hopefully we'll have time for discussion as well let me just remind you briefly where we stand in terms of the class and the v-model in particular we you know we made great progress and we've essentially covered the whole left side the bottom and what we'll do starting next week is really climb up on the right side so next week's topic is system integration and interface management then we'll cover verification validation commissioning and operations and then our final lecture official lecture is lifecycle management we do have a a twelfth lecture on prototyping and manufacturing that window is optional because this is after the you know official end of classes at MIT so you don't you're not expected to participate but you're invited to so we'll basically the focus in the next month or so is covering the right side of the V so let me start talking about the the midterm exam and we'll sort of go question by question and please stop me if you have any comments or questions let's make this interactive so question one if a complex electromechanical system has 1850 individual part numbers this is at the lowest level how many levels do you expect the drawing tree to have everybody provided the same answer for right this is basically a straight application of the magic number seven rule and you know in practice you know you'll see you know if you you not everybody will go exactly for four levels but that's that's the basic idea if you stay if you decompose the system with this human cognitive bandwidth in mind for a system of that level of complexity you should expect roughly a four layer decomposition so I'm I'm very pleased that you know everybody sort of got this answer but with the caveat that you know it's it's not a it's you know there may be deviations from this rule and you can go for a flatter tree with fewer levels but you have to be aware of you know the implications that that may have okay so that's that's great the next question was the next question was okay so you're attending a cocktail party and cocktail parties I don't think that's maybe that's very 20th century I don't think we we have cocktail parties anymore so maybe more like a Google hangout or you know the 21st century equivalent but the basic idea here is how would you explain what system engineering is to somebody who's not a technical person not an you know not an engineer and I think most of you I looked through all the answers and most of you basically provided you know a definition of system engineering that we would use in this class right so it was it was like okay well not quite what I was looking for but not incorrect so I pulled out two examples that I kind of liked because they brought in sort of analogies from other fields as to what system engineering is so the first one here is okay so system engineering represents a method but also a mindset that enables the design and so forth of successful systems but systems engineering is like cooking a delicious cake okay so it's it's it's like you know cooking a delicious recipe you've got your ingredients which is your part numbers your parts right it's it's you have a process that you're following and and at the end of it you know you should have something special something delicious something wholesome something that is greater than the sum of the parts you know and what's I don't know if any of you watch the Food Channel anybody watching the Food Network here yeah okay we we actually like to watch it it's kind of fun and what's fun is when you give the same ingredients right to like half a dozen different people and same ingredients same amount of time and the result that comes out of it is vastly different right now why is that of course you can say skills and so forth but it is fundamentally because those ingredients the details matter right the way in which the ingredients get combined and and you know did you use the right heat that you did you take it off the heat 30 seconds too soon or too late those little details make a huge difference to the final product okay and and that's what I think what's cool about you know the the Food Network and cooking in general cuisine is it's an art it's not just you know sort of follow the recipe and so I think that's a great analogy I like that and then the other one is so the you're you're talking to share the singer and explain to her that system engineering is like concert okay so in a concert you have all your specialists right that you have your choir maybe you have your string section you have your trumpets and I think it's kind of similar you could have great individual musicians but if the conductor is not bringing everybody in the harmony then you know you get a cacophony right it's not a great result so a great orchestra is not just a bunch of great individual musicians but it's it's the idea that you you're orchestrating there's something special that emerges if you synchronize everybody in a way and you motivate them and you synchronize them and something really special happens so I think that's another great sort of example of what we mean by system engineering in the technical world this idea of a conductor you know bringing everybody in harmony and in the end result is something really special okay so those are kind of that's a little bit what I was looking for in this answer and I like both of these examples the third the third question was about the v-model and I think based on what I looked through the answers I think most people really understood that and just to summarize again in a very very simple way what the v-model is all about so here's the V if you wanted to really simplify it we start at the upper left with a vision you know what is it that we're trying to accomplish and that's where you need to understand you know this it was the stakeholder who are the customers the thing that you're about to create doesn't exist yet and some projects you actually start with you know an initial system and you need to improve it right so you starting with generation n of a prod product and the goal is to create generation n plus one which is better in several dimensions so that's possible but let's just say we have a clean sheet situation and you have a vision that you're developing and then you okay all right you are now connected on speaker with the encoding furniture director fantastic can you hear me yes we can all right this is great so I am I was just going over the midterm exam that we just had and so I will stop doing that because we're very glad that you're that that we can spend time with you so let's let's make this bigger on our end and do you have a camera on your end Tina what say no because the demographics here will have to go on toys Holly okay Tina can we see you can we se you see one of you at least we're working on it multipad it would be helpful to see at least who's speaking [Music] you got a problem here all right well shall we go ahead and kick off here Ollie I know your time is valuable okay Ryan can we make the cosy board board of directors the the main screen here just give me one second on our end that's 15 minutes with Janice that's right Holly can I suggest we just pressed ahead despite the desire to see David shiny tape okay all right so David it's great to talk to you so let me just give you a little bit of background here so we have about 20 students here at MIT currently we're taking the fundamentals of systems engineering class we're we're roughly mid term a little bit past the mid term and then we have about 20 students maybe 15 students and staff at EPFL and Switzerland and we're teaching this class in the form of a SPOC small private online course and so welcome to MIT to then cause II Board of Directors I know you've already had very productive times and we're really excited to hear from you as to not just what is in cozy but where do you see systems engineering as a field of study and practice stand you know what are the what are the exciting things happening what are the challenges and whatever you would choose to share with us so so David very good thanks - thanks ollie and thank you for making the time available it is always great to talk with the next generation I'll give you just a few comments upfront and then really open it up for those who aren't familiar with encode C it's the International Council on systems engineering it's about 25 years old about 10,000 members worldwide and the value of an cosy fundamentally is to serve as a connector across the systems community across organizational boundaries across geographic boundaries so that we can connect the practice in the u.s. to Europe to Asia and beyond they are applied differently and across domain boundaries from military and aerospace where we have our foundation to automotive to medical devices and beyond if you look at it as systems engineers that perhaps the most exciting thing of what's going on if you look at how complexity continues to emerge and grow the problems that we are being asked to tackle the technologies at our disposal the opportunities for wonderful outcomes the dangers and risks of unintended consequences the challenges that the world faces are absolutely systems challenges and they are far beyond the traditional aerospace and defense domain they are everywhere I was with GM earlier this week looking at automated driving and Auto assist I was with medical devices and iRobot yesterday and wherever you look whatever domain you work in we see complexity we see systems challenges and we see tremendous opportunities for us as professionals but more than that for systems professionals to have a profound positive impact on the world so it's going to be a very challenging journey we are still working to solidify our foundation to advance our theories to advance our practice but it is a very fruitful time I think as well so those are the comments that I will offer at the start and then open it up to the class to ask the questions of this board of directors ok David that was that was great and so who wants to be first don't be shy either here at MIT or at EPFL Sam go for it I was wondering when you're creating I guess Stan and cozy standards for systems engineering processes what considerations do you take into account in order to make them applicable for such a wide range of disciplines or domains introduce yourself man over speakers this is Paul trying to make us I'm the technical director thank you for asking well actually inkosi is not a standard body standard-setting body but we are supporting a lot of standards like iso fifty to eighty eight and what we add lead try to achieve is that the standards are being applied in multiple domains as much as possible does that answer your question yeah thanks okay and and just so you know we we do have 15 to 88 as one of the that's kind of we have three in the class here we covered sort of three standards one is the system engineering handbook the nasa of course the in cozy handbook and then 15 to 88 so I think the students should be familiar with 15 to 88 so that that that was good okay can we have a question from epfl are you still with us guys no do you hear me yes good okay les McKeown Rivera I just have a question about the the complexity of systems with those systems being more and more complex over time would system engineers or engineering itself have to reinvent itself in the future and what would be the direction thank you I'm president-elect Irvin cozy but but more importantly I co-chair our system of systems working group I think the answer is is no to reinvention because I'm I'm confident all the principled stand but what we've been doing is a working group is identifying where engineering and system assistance is different and we constructed a paper which has been published on the pain point to the system of systems looking at the managerial and the technical differences and therefore helping people when planning their work see in which cases they can pick up their traditional ways of working and where if you like experienced practitioners see problems or challenges in other areas so that working group is it helping develop so understand and develop the state of practice for for complex system of systems and that's proved quite influential and in fact if you are using the latest edition of the FE handbook in a section on system of systems it does highlight those pain points so they are they're helping shape what people do hopefully hopefully that's the views Thank You Alan very good we I think we've only touched mentioned system of systems in the class so far we haven't really deep dive into that topic but it's it's a great point okay and back to MIT all right my question is about the systems engineering vision you have on the website about 2025 what are what have you been done about the protocols or languages that could be developed to facilitate the communication between the systems engineering nose and different stakeholders that's a really good question you know this idea of having the same language so by the way I'm Mike Celentano deputy technical director of operations the idea of having a common language is really important you know one of the things that I've started with in healthcare that's my industry is trying to convince people to speak the same language and I've since given that up what I when I'm teaching people now is to understand the other people's language so they could communicate better and so when you go from domain to domain it's important that you spend some time learning the language a lot like it's important to learn how to say hello and goodbye in the language of the country that you're visiting it's it's important to understand the domain that you're exploring so that you can make the interpretation and help those people with systems-engineering does that answer your question all right yeah yes thank you and and Olli if you don't mind I'm gonna follow up and then art will as well what that question calls out and what I think Mike's answer calls out is they're very there are two very important dimensions in my opinion of systems engineering we are the glue to the project team but we are the glue in two different dimensions there's the engineering aspect of what we do and there is very real engineering analysis that needs to occur at the system's level we unify the subject matter experts and we bring those understandings together whether it's in medical whether it's an aerospace regardless but the other aspect that we cannot avoid as systems engineers is the communication role because we are working with people who do not speak the same common language whether that's speaking between aerospace and medical or whether that's on an aerospace project speaking between computer science reliability mechanical electrical as systems engineers we must embrace the communication aspect and the translator aspect that might call it out because each of us speak a different language for a particular reason art and to help in that regard one of the products that in Cosi has helped create is the systems engineering body of knowledge which is available a website which Ali is quite familiar with which has several hundred articles about systems engineering but one of the projects that we are going to be and it's its domain neutral so it's it's not tied to a specific business sector one of the projects that we are expecting to begin in 2016 is to create a variant of that in some fashion for the healthcare community tying it to the unique way they talk about things their approaches but tie effect to the common underlying principles and if we are successful in that as we expect I can imagine is spinning up ones for transportation for telecommunications etc so that that can become a glue in essence for people across many different business sectors very good so I will I will make sure that we we provide the link to the body of knowledge which I know was a very big effort to put together will will provide that information for the students as well great that's excellent unfortunately for time I'm gonna have to ask art to to give us a wrap-up but but let me just say one thing because I'm not sure how well you can see the video over here but you guys are talking to a group of about 20 people from around the world we have people here from France Sweden Australia and the people that you just talked to are also engineering senior engineering leaders at Airbus and BAE and so they kind of range a broad spectrum here and also Roche from different industries so I'll hand it over to art to give you a good summary but I hope that you continue to keep in touch with with this group well this is where I'm gonna make my small pitch for membership so as students you have an opportunity for only 38 dollars u.s. annually to be members of inkosi which gives you access to all of our products which are includes videos that are reported every month handbooks doc sorts of documents and I'd really like to encourage you to consider that as an option it's it's a great it's something like a quarter of what you'd have to pay as a full professional and so I'm gonna let it go with that no art I think that was great and I'll just say from from my perspective no I first got involved inin cozy a little more than a decade ago and I think both you know the the industry academic mix the conferences you know this is real this is not you know a community that's living in a bubble and so I I would I would fully endorse that art alright so well I think I think we're at the end of this inter you know this is cool I mean that you know the technology is gotten to the point where certainly the audio part of this was very clear and you know and that's and that's terrific so we want to thank you for your time I have a great continuation of your board meeting and we're gonna keep learning over here we're good thank you so much Holly alright well I hope you found that useful and I'll provide you a link to the body of knowledge I think that's one thing that we haven't sort of pointed out so let me just let's go back to a EPFL are you still with us okay thank you let me let me just sort of finish on the midterm yes Veronica okay thank you when I was looking over their website I seen a lot about kind of communicating for the sake of engineers and everything else but I think that systems engineering in particular has an ability to shape the way that we kind of regulate policy developments I feel like a lot of times scientific advancement is working against international regulatory standards or I feel like an entity like and cosey has an ability to kind of shape international collaboration in a way that can help scientists achieve more together and so I was kind of wondering what with the role they they might have seen or what you might see as kind of an international collaboration like that taking in terms of shaping the ways in which we engineer together not just the ways in which we we kind of create and systems engineering naturally but kind of more collaborative I think it's a it's a great question and I think the system engineering is sort of evolving and broadening you know the classic view of system engineering is you know that's what a company or a big project that that's producing a physical deliverable you know a new airplane a new computer healthcare device you know a new software system that's the out you know and then that's a capability that you put out into the market into the field and regulations and policies are given to you you know their constraints their requirements I think what you're saying is well the policies themselves are something to be designed I think oh she ate it and you know that's a that's a broadening of the system boundary and the mandate for system engineering and so here at MIT you know over the last 15 years or so the word we've used for that is engineering systems so we kind of flipped the to words and say that system engineering in a more traditional sense is scope scope smaller and then when you internalize the externalities like you know economics policy and you consider that part of the design space as well then you're in the world of engineering systems or complex socio technical systems and so absolutely there's a and you heard the answer that Alan Harding was the present the president-elect of a cosy he will take over from Dave long next year when he started talking about system of systems mm-hmm well you know what our system of systems for example Air Tran air traffic management right air train let's take an example air traffic management air transportation in in North America there's this project called next-gen right next generation that's a very complex system of systems and in Europe the equivalent is the project called Cesare it's essentially the unified European airspace well you've got it's not just about flight controllers and radar stations you know and GPS available navigation a lot of it has to do with policy and you know how do you do the handoffs who's responsible - you know report any anomalies how do you do backup operations and so forth so a good example when that came to the fore is I don't know if you remember the Icelandic volcano a few years ago the volcano erupted and then there was this big ash cloud right and then the question was well is it safe to fly through the sash cloud and who actually has the authority to decide which part of the airspace is closed and is open and then you've got the airlines saying you know open up the airspace because you know we're losing a lot of business every day and you know the regulators are saying wait you know we need to be cautious here so I think what you're saying is that's a system engineering problem that we could sort of address and so things are moving that way but I think our our methodologies for doing that work in a rigorous way are not quite there yet is that a type of advocacy that a group like in Cosi could move toward I I can see from their from their mission statement everything that's not something they're doing now but is that a place that you see that they couldn't fill it could be and I think I think they're moving that way okay thank you yeah okay any other other points anybody wants to add from the discussion okay you know one questions on my side go ahead if I can so I think that's a very good point Veronica in terms of how do you chance to policy or business management and some time ago I was trying to see if there are actually jobs or careers that are called systems engineer but besides ITU there's really not a profession you know for example you're doing this in the policy domain could you just be the systems engineer of say for example the first energy mode I'm working on currently kind of the source energy transition know the systems engineer and that would be your role or their careers and clear names that are especially like designing the systems and engineering them that's a question right Katja I think the mic the mic is off go ahead okay yeah are there jobs that do this like are there systems engineering jobs there's that project management that's a good question so you know the job profiles of system engineers have been broadening there is also system architects right and we have a we you know we when we talk about concept generation here concept selection that's in a sense a specialty within system engineering known as system architecture so you'll have more and more people hand you a business card that says on the system architect and what that means is they're in charge of you know the high-level decisions the left the upper left side of the V that's shown here so system architect system engineers and there's also a very this didn't come up in the discussion with and cozy but there's a very active discussion going on right now between ecozy that has about 10,000 members and as 2025 years old and an organization called PMI project management institute which is older and has about 400,000 members globally and that's the people you know running big projects so you know those job descriptions are still coming from different angles but we do see this bigger discussion emerging and I think the the organizations that are enlightened that really understand that these big system decisions are critical and that you you can't just make those arbitrarily you need people who actually think about the whole system who model and simulate the whole system who look at different scenarios you need dedicated people for that who would not just have the education and the experience to do it but have the job title to do it as well and the authority and so I think we're we're seeing a transition to those new kinds of jobs especially in the enlightened organizations okay yes one one more more and then we'll yeah um so when you say that someone needs to have a designated title of a systems engineer to really do it well is there an advantage or disadvantage to having everyone be a systems engineer with a specialty so that you're training an entire organization to think about the big picture because I can see pros and cons but I'm wondering is there a hard answer my position on this is you remember we talked a little bit about the value of system engineering like how much should you invest in system engineering and we'll come back to this at the end of term but generally you can see that that there's empirical data that says you should spend roughly 10 to 20 percent of your budget yeah on maybe 15% is sort of the sweet spot on systems engineering system architecture type activities which happens to be one in 7 1 over 7 as 15% roughly right so if you're going to on you know on average decompose your systems into seven chunks right at each level of decomposition then you need about one one out of seven people or one out of eight or one out of seven people their primary focus should be on how the chunks fit together not designing the individual chunks and so there's a lot of empirical evidence that suggests that if you spend a lot less effort on system integration than about 15 percent of your total budget you're gonna have real problems you will miss requirements you'll have poorly managed interfaces you'll have surprises during tests thing if you spend a lot more than 15% on system engineering activities the project they will be very heavy too much bureaucracy too many processes it gets slower so we'll come back to that but so the the everybody should have some understanding of what system engineering is even if you're a subject matter expert specialty person if you do cost modeling or if you do you know control systems propulsion medical you know in the medical field biocompatible materials whatever it is you do everybody should know something about system engineering but then you do need that's my opinion the dedicated people who really focus on the integration the interface is how the chunks fit together and if you don't have that for projects that are of a certain level of complexity you're gonna have big problems okay Katya was that was that reasonable all right so let's let's move on here with the exam because we have a very I think exciting interesting presentation to get to so the V is essentially you have this vision you then decompose requirements subsystems and then the bottom of the V is the details every little detail needs to be defined and then the right side is we go and then integrate everything together and we go to operations so I think most most of you really explain that quite well question 4 what is the most important aspect of the V model that is not shown explicitly in the V and I think the two answers here and I think both are correct so the iterative nature of design we'll hear about this in the octane 'iz project so the V model does not imply that you're automatically doing a waterfall stage-gate process you're only doing trade studies once you know you're only you're only testing once that's not what it means it just means that there's there's a logical sequence to the activities but you could actually spiral through the V multiple times so the iterative nature of design and then the possibility of schedule and cost overruns this is the the programmatic side is not shown in the venal but it's implied so both of these are correct so this is very good question five at which of the following milestones should the main concept or architecture of the system selected so here we have a little bit of a spread of answers the correct answer here should be PDR Palamon a design review that's when that's when the concept the architecture the high level decomposition of the system the assignment of functions to those chunks at level one or level two should be defined SRR it's too early at the SRR all you're trying to do at the SRR system requirements review is agree on what the requirements are what the system should achieve but not necessarily at how the how that will be achieved and then at CDR I would say it's too late right the CDR is where you lay out all the details of how the system will be built operated the software so the the high level design the concept the architecture should have been decided and agreed upon way before the CDR and it's the PDR where that's happening so I think you know about 3/4 of you got it right here the next one was a little subtle question what are the following attributes should a set of requirements meet and I put checkmarks here but what were the so there were multiple correct answers so the set of requirements means multiple and ensemble of requirements as opposed to just a single requirement in isolation so you know feasible verifiable and unambiguous those three answers are correct for individual requirements each individual requirement should be feasible verifiable and an unambiguous but when you look at a set of requirements that's when these other three come into play absence or redundancy so what this means is that you shouldn't replicate the same requirement essentially across multiple requirements in your requirements set and and one of the reasons for that is if you change a requirement then you might miss it somewhere else right this redundancy is keep keep it keep it as simple as straight forward as you can completeness that basically means that the requirements set that you develop should cover all the requirements you shouldn't have big holes and missing ornaments and then the last point is absence of conflicts if you have requirements conflicts essentially what this means is you have no feasible there's no feasible solution so if you think about optimization you have an over constrained problem basically that's what that means okay any any questions about these two yeah okay I have a question for the size the question files I think the question is a little bit ambiguous because if the main concept is selected on the PDR on a time scale on the CDR you have the main concept sorry you can say that on the CDR it's also the main concept selective already ah I see what you're saying so yeah so maybe I should have said what is the what is the earliest milestone at which the concept that's really what I meant is you know what's the what's the milestone where the the concept has to be agreed upon and then of course at the CDR unless you had to overturn your concept selection which happens sometimes you should stick with the same but but the intent here was to say this is PDR okay go ahead what are this question number five I've got I think I got confused with the concept architecture so just to be clear about that the concept operations is what the system does and the architecture is just what are just a list of the subsystems and what are the mass energy and information flow that's right that's right the concept of operations that's actually an SRR the concept of our prejudice book how will the system be used right and then the concept the architecture is given this concept of operations what are the functions that have to happen and then which chunks in your system support or enable what functions that's essentially what it is yeah okay any anything else all right question seven I think most of you got this right and we we're gonna get to verification and validation in a lot more detail but there is a distinction some people use verification and validation interchangeably they think it's the same it's different words for the same thing that's not quite the case okay so here we've got your verification loop and your validation loop to put it very succinctly oops to put it very succinctly verification is in verification you're answering the question did you satisfy the requirements as they were written right that's the inner loop you've got your requirements set and then you do verification or inspection or there's different ways of checking that but you check do we meet the requirements as they were written that's the inner loop and then validation is the outer loop where you say go back to the stakeholders and then you say the CONOPS right can we actually execute the CONOPS and does the system meet the expectations of the stakeholders does it deliver value to them and so it's it's quite possible and they're there examples of systems that actually successfully pass verification you can check every requirement say yep yep yep yep we can do that and then you demonstrate the the product or the system to the stakeholders and they say oh no that's that's not at all what we were looking for and then the question is well did you change your mind you know customer benefit did you change the mind from today to when we started this this project right or was there some error and translation going from the steak or the stakeholders didn't change their mind you know their their their use cases they're cops they're they're the value they want to get from the system hasn't changed since you started the project but there was some error in translation between those high level stakeholder expectations and then the requirements no maybe you missed the requirement so that that's the that's the key idea here between V and B and we'll we'll talk a lot more about this in the next few weeks all right now comes the one you've all been waiting for I know question eight so here's the rocket equation Delta V the change in velocity of a rocket that you can achieve is equal to gravity times the specific impulse times the log of your initial mass so this is your rocket on the launch pad okay and over mi which is the final mass after the burn has happened okay and so one thing that's important is to define those masses and there were I got we got we got a lot of emails write this Jana would you say this was probably the most emails we've gotten all semester is about this question so so the a bunch of questions were just about the definition of mass fraction what is the mass fraction and they're really two different interpretations of it and it turned out it didn't matter which one you used because the answer was the same so the one that I'm showing you here is that the initial mass here is 1 plus alpha times M F your mass of fuel plus your payload so in this case alpha is the percentage of the mass that's that you're launching the fuel and the payload that's made up of structure which includes tankage support structure the engines themselves etc the other definition you could use which is equally valid you just have to define it is that alpha is only applied to the fuel mass right that you've got the fuel which in this case is liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen and then you have your tanks and your engine right that's your mass fraction and then the payload sits on top and there's no overhead for the pie carrying the payload and either way it didn't matter in this question because the answer was the same so here the your initial mass is one plus alpha times the mass of the fuel which is unknown and the mass of the payload which is given 20 metric tons and then m1 is simply alpha times mass of the fuel and mass of the payload so you can slightly rearrange there are different ways you know of solving this problem a simple way is this you just basically bring the constants over to the left side so Delta B over G is P and then basically the right side has to be larger than that so this is essentially your 1 plus alpha divided by alpha because the MF plus MP term falls out if you formulate it that way so you can just plug in the numbers that were given in the problem and you can see that the left-hand side does not match the right-hand side right and the conclusion from this and if you could some of you tried to solve for the fuel mass you know there's all kinds of ways and and you just it's super frustrating and I know a lot of you spent a lot of time trying to solve this problem and no matter what way you get you get negative right you get negative fuel mass you get all kinds of weird things trying to make this work the bottom line is infeasible requirement it's not possible with the required though this is a an example of an infeasible requirement okay and I did this on purpose to show you that just because somebody writes a requirement down you know that it doesn't mean it's feasible right so so most I think many of you got this and we're frustrated by it but I want to show you a real project where this this happened so you could then ask well what would what would we have to do to make it feasible so some of you said well maybe we can achieve less Delta V or we need even better propulsion higher ISP or which is which is maybe a little bit more straightforward what would be the mass fraction the Alpha that you would have to achieve to make this work and the answer is somewhere around 8% depending on which definition of mass fraction you used it's you know 7 to 8% so it means that if you want to achieve single-stage-to-orbit flight with no staging which is the current way we do it you have to get the mass fraction below 8% and that includes everything the tanks the support structure the engines and that's really really really tough so I know you were frustrated by this problem many of you but let me tell you this story those folks were really frustrated so there was actually a program here in the US in the late 90s that tried to as a technologies small scale technology demonstrator demonstrate the technology is required to get to orbit with a single stage vehicle and that program was called the x-33 run by Lockheed Martin so single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle demonstrator the target mass this is your M 0 total mass 130 metric tons the target mass fraction was point 1 and fuel was just the same as in this problem Lux Lux hydrogen and the project basically was cancelled in 2001 after about one point three billion dollars had been spent on it and the main the thing that eventually really led to the cancellation was the the fuel tank there was a composite material fuel tank that was embedded inside the wing here inside this body as very complex shape and those of you that know about hydrogen atoms are very very small it's very tough to to contain hydrogen it wants to leak that's it's its natural tendency is to leak out so the this this composite fuel tank basically couldn't be built and tested under pressure to be leak proof and they really tried they spent a lot of money on it a lot of effort couldn't be done and so NASA concluded you know and you know the goal was here to achieve to achieve essentially this this mass fraction of you know ten percent or below and at that time in the late 90s early 2000s this was just not feasible with the state of Technology and so this is you know think about how frustrated I know you spent an hour so trying to solve this and and we're not happy about it but think about how they felt so the purpose of this I think most of this midterm exam was kind of a gift up until this question I was wondering about the mass fraction so I read the text over there and it says it's suborbital this was a plan to even reduce that mass fraction even further if this was a success right so it was so this would not have achieved orbital velocity and it's so it's not a complete one-to-one map because I gave you also a higher Delta V right I give you 11 kilometers per second and you need this which is escape velocity and you really need about you need to achieve about seven point five but with losses and you know dragon gravity losses you really need to achieve about 99.5 so it's not a one-to-one map but but you sort of get the you sort of get the idea okay any any question about this at EPFL did you hear this was it was it fairly clear you know yeah I think you all know aside okay all right so if you want to read more about the x-33 this this article the Wikipedia article is pretty good and there's a lot so just to say you know I don't I think we're gonna try this again I think there's gonna be new efforts composite materials have come a long way composite manufacturing you know 15 years later we might try this again pretty soon okay question 9 this is actually so this was a little bit of you know computation here so this yeah the intent of this question was to for you to think about competing objectives right the purrito frontiers we talked about this in the concept selection so this is the idea of you're designing a a can or container for containing liquids the shape is cylindrical as shown in red and so the two things you care about is volume how much how much liquid can you carry inside the can that's simply PI R squared H and then your surface area which you could say that's the cost of the container right that's the amount of material you need to use is two PI R those are the top and bottom right and then 2 R PI H which is your circumference and if you then plot for different combinations of radius and height what is the volume and surface area which is shown in this plot here surface area as the y-axis and volume on the x-axis and you want to so you the ideas you want to maximize volume while minimizing surface area by changing the radius and the height subject to these constraints shown here you should have gotten something that looks like this blue curve right this is this is the purrito frontier and the question was well where's the utopia point the utopia point is down to the lower right maybe you plotted it differently that's fine so you want as high a volume as you can with minimum surface area but the best you can achieve there's there's nothing in this white space here the best you can achieve is this blue curve and above it and so then I'm plotting to a small and a big one so this the coca-cola can is as shown the soda can is in the lower left corner and you can see it's pretty much on the perio front and then this is the standard 55 US gallon oil barrels you know if you go to like a junkyard or you know that you know a refinery you'll see these barrels of oil actually it's it's not exactly on the Pareto front but it's very very close okay so that was that was the the intent here any any questions about this yes sump shion's not really the the key one of the key assumptions but that was given was that you should assume zero thickness right so it's it's just a volume versus surface there's no actual you know thickness and I need to double check so when I when I looked at the the height of the different cans yeah were we supposed to leave the problem as defined in terms of the original units if you updated the units as the maximum height to be within a reasonable range right not two meters versus 900 millimeters it neither point was on the on the Pareto front it just depended on how what you defined your upper limit to be oh and I was wondering if we were expected to maintain the original upper limit or if we were allowed to change it oh if you change it that's fine this is you know this the the basic idea of this question was to understand what is a purrito frontier okay you know whatever and you know to actually think about you know something we we you know we use it almost every day you know we we drink a soda or something like that and and that's not that shape is not a randomly selected shape it's actually based on a trade-off between volume and efficiency right volume and surface area and and here you go here's where it falls on the on the pre de partir that's sort of the the general idea but we we haven't graded the exams yet but well well I think will be fairly generous on this question okay so then the last one was really the that's this so more about very recent happenings but when you read if you read the article you realized while there's kind of a prehistory here this is not just something that happened a month ago there's a long history leading up to this emissions scandal and the key the key table in the article is this table shown here it's essentially these n o X numbers for emissions where you had the different so these are requirements right these are regulatory requirements and a big part of the story is that the requirements this is just for diesel engines right this applies for diesel engines in the US and in Europe are different and so you can see that the limit is essentially the regulatory requirement the dyno the in shown in green here is demonstrate this is verification right did you meet did you satisfy the requirement as written and you can argue that because this these vehicles had software in them that the purpose of the software was to detect whether or not the vehicle is being tested for emissions and the reason you can do it is because the drive cycles are very tightly prescribed so if the vehicle is operating exactly you know at the speeds and velocities that correspond one-to-one to those test drive cycles the software knew ah I'm being tested for emissions you know and and you know it's it's like you know knowing that you're being watched as a kid and you're behaving because you know you behaving because you know you're being watched you and then whenever you think you're not being watched you do something very different right that's that's the general idea so the Green was basically the dyno results with the the cheating essentially with the software embedded and then the West Virginia University results which were you know this independent testing showed that the actual emissions during operat regular operations were about 30 times worse right then then this and the trade-off here is of with fuel efficiency right that's the that's the big trade-off and so you know well we haven't read your answers yet to this question but it's extremely relevant to system engineering and and in particular to the distinction between verification and validation right so you can argue that verification was passed here because it passes the the dyno tests these are the the regulatory tests that are prescribed but it fails essentially in the field to satisfy the requirements one thing I'll be very interested you know and of course Volkswagen has admitted you know that they have this that they cheated in a set in essence but I'll be I'll be very interested to see how the legal the legal side of this works out because because in in in if you if you interpret this very narrowly and you you cannot say that those vehicles failed their emission standard tests because they've performed properly on the dyno so to what extent are these requirements these environmental requirements which are very in a sense narrowly defined in terms of how these requirements are verified legally binding in terms of being able to perform at those levels outside of the DRI the drive cycle test cases that are prescribed by law did you see what I'm saying so even though morally I think we've we've you know people generally say this Volkswagen has cheated because they're essentially reconfiguring the vehicle depending on whether it's being tested officially or not but from a from a legal perspective I'm not sure this is this is fully done yet so we'll have to see how the the lawsuits and all these things play out go ahead and Eric would you would you say that looking at it from the regulator's perspective that they had set up an expectation that didn't flow into a requirement and if it was a requirement it was unverifiable until WVU it was an unverifiable requirement in a sense i that's one way to say it and you know maybe what is the response to this well one response could be a whole bunch of more test cases you know the the the actual drive cycles that are going to have to be tested are going to be much more I don't know we'll see this this is a big deal not just for folks wagon but I think it's a very big deal in the bigger picture of how do regulatory requirements and standards apply to all kinds of products right and and how do you check them let's see real quick if there's a question at EPFL any comments questions regulation actually in Europe it was forbidden and explicitly forbidden to introduce addressed to guys in the car yeah yeah and there's penalties for that right okay I just wonder if you've seen any analysis on like WVU doing tests on other vehicles to compare what they show in their dynamos versus what they're emitting in real life even though it might not be this extreme I don't I don't know what tests they've done internally we call the test two being so different from the actual real-life driving nobody accelerates from zero to 30 in 30 seconds that's what the test is so yeah but so there's a real real strong connection here with system engineering and you know that was the purpose of this question is to sort of push this question was not a gift you know this was really sort of really required you to dig in and it was very timely I think ok so that's so cheap to meet requirements failed validation that's what I would say is this quick summary any any final questions comments about the the online the quiz the midterm quiz okay so we've had we've had our interactive discussion with the encodes a Board of Directors so hopefully you enjoyed that and we are now right on time to hand it over to octane as' and rafael will present this rafael Fabien Chu so this is essentially you'll hear it's about the design manufacturing and deployment of a rover for extreme environment Antarctica in particular and so we look forward to Raphael's presentation and as you listen to Raphael think about what you learned in this class so far how does it connect and I think Raphael also tried to gear the presentation a bit to the system engineering concepts so I'm I'm gonna sell I'm just going to present myself quickly I'm studying here my master's in Nano and micro electronics and I'm speaking in behalf of Dennis so just in case the image quality wouldn't be perfect you can find this presentation at MIT and here on tiny dog pc /bo katanas and so to see the picture and well Tanis is a association that which is recently founded and we have certain certain key values that are so fascination is one of them we said moonshot goals and then get very passionate about this we want to build affordable products so we use open source software we 3d print parts and so on we use off-the-shelf components and we want to do open the design so we share our code on github we share our mechanical designs to the community and one point is also education so we ourselves what I want to learn from from what were you doing and wanna make others benefit from our learning and try to help them as well with their project and well how we tackle things is kind of summarized in this in this statement from Tom Chi from Google X so we minimize the track at the time to try things and maximize the the time of learning that means we we iterate very fast we do a prototype very fast we go on with the idea with a prototype with a sketch design and so on and we tried if you fail just move on try the next thing and you know that's that's basically how we did and the first project that just emerge out of this procedure is a Kleenex one so that's that's what I'm going to talk about today so maybe quickly about the team so the rule seven plus minus 1 plus minus 2 applies here as well so we eight members right now working on that River from different fields from engineering physics life signs as well and the story began actually when when Sam who is here as well for the Q&A just in case and Anna found about this competition or or that that call from Ecuador that was about building a or sending a project a student project or whatever to Antarctica and they thought well let's soon as we take this challenge and we were gonna put a rover on that honor and weather balloon send it from South America to to Antarctica and deploy it there let it drive around for one for one summer and let's see what happens and well they started immediately with doing simulations there's that online tool that allows to kind of predict the optimal time for a trajectory in the air so a particle or an object in year that will have have a desired trajectory and you can kind of find out the the best moment in the year to notice and there was actually demonstrated kind of two to show that this was possible to to to have this trajectory and well I heard about this later and they asked me if I could do the electronics design of this as with the main Gordon song and I was fascinated by the project so I joined in anything but at the same time I saw all the challenges that we have to solve so I thought about all the problems we had for instance what happens if we lose the balloon in the ocean what happens if we run out of power and the temperature drops rather it was an arm breaks and you know we cannot get up anymore and but at some point I just realized that well all we do is we just send a balloon with a rover to and petaca and we're going to deploy it there and it will drive around and I think that's that's something we star in this in this class because I'm following this class very passively on WebEx and with the videos so yeah yeah the thing that you have to see is that big picture as a system engineer right you see the whole mission and you don't care about the details at this level but you're going to decompose the problem into specific subproblems and have groups or people working on this and that's it so it just looked in it to me in the end it's going to do it and and we started with the first problem and just to give you an idea that that's one of our last prototypes so that that's either the rover is going to look like you see two two struts with wheels on each side solar panels and twenty printer pipes for 3d printed wheels and struts and you see our the balloon in our logo and we're not going to do the balloon right now but the first mission will just be the rover itself and that that's life basically summarizes the goal so the mission of cannas one is to build a usable autonomous solar-powered and open-source Rover for outdoors and in this case for for an extreme environment like Antarctica so let's go down the v-model right first there is the stakeholder analysis in Erica is pretty simple it's the Institute Antarctic Institute from Ecuador which we contacted and showed our product project and they were pretty happy about this and I want to learn more so we presented our project we send in a proposal and there are now writing the final documents for them and what we basically have to provide is just you know the the goals of the mission and the scientific findings we're gonna and we're gonna have so we will produce a paper at the end of this and write about what we what we found and further down the V models will be the requirements so we can we can look at some requirements so the power system of the river shall provide 10 watts on average so we figured that out after putting like writing down a power budget we want to drive around that will cost that much power and that will be that that much time during the day like and and so on so that that was the number we came up with of the interior temperature shall not drop below 20 degrees minus 20 degrees Celsius or about one where zero Fahrenheit that's that's basically the point where you cannot discharge the battery and charge the battery anymore because well because of the chemical composition so standard batteries you shouldn't go below minus-10 degrees that's really a hard requirement we have to provide the total rate shall not exceed two point five kilograms basically we look already at the further mission for the balloon so it shouldn't be too too expensive to to put the helium like to buy the helium and so on and the rover Shah would be able to communicate to to us from any point you're for that we basically use the uranium Network which which is you can pay like four four text message can pay something and you can send your message from any point of the world there's a bunch of satellites covering the whole planet basically and all those rubbish all managed to climb the slope the certain slope that just to assure that we can not just drive on flat terrain there's also some sugar requirements where 14 degrees come from is that did you do like a terrain analysis on Antarctica or how did you come up with 14 degrees as the requirement for the for this hill climbing we we basically looked at the motors we would to have in mind to take and and figured out that that's that's basically what they can do and we tested it so I'm going to talk about this later we didn't do this top-down only but we looked at what we have and what you can do and that's what we figured that would be a reasonable kind of choice but yeah good question so the sugar requirements covered the reproducible reproducibility so any non expert should also be able to build this your over and just without being an engineer use it as well the cost should stay below 1,000 bucks so the material cost only of course not the IND the range should be on one kilometer today that's kind of in the order of magnitude of the Curiosity rover so we're not dressed we not we don't have to go fast we have weeks or months to be there so one kilometer per day is just fine there should also be room for a scientific payload room means physical space and also certain conditions like temperature humidity inside depending on the on the experiment and well it should survive one Antarctic summer so that implies also the conditions that we have there like the weather and the the Sun radiation and so on so with all style we had our first diagram so pardon the knife a representation this is not what we learned in this class but that's what we had right so it's this class is mostly on the on the electronic focus there's a main board in the middle I'm not sure if you see that clearly but main board with a bunch of centers up here and over camera and RF modules for communication and some axillary board for for the scientific payload for instance we we kept going with this and we basically designed the PCB with all these components and most of it worked as well we also thought about the mechanics of course so this this design is inspired from from a NASA project that was in the end abandoned because was too high in cost but still this nano rover for asteroids was kind of having the same structure so two struts that would allow to flip the rover entirely around if it gets clipped by the wind and also put it more flat or align it to the to the Sun so that it gets the maximum of the energy and yeah that's what we had and we went out with our first prototype it's pretty cute right we went to Sweden with that it has a bunch of cheap Chinese solar cells from eBay and but the rules and actions are already 3d printed tile our first mainboard and it was just you know capable of driving around somewhere on the snow and we were in testing the parachute until only came back and it worked a few times but in the end of the Heather kind of thing an incident so we we could really test it and analyze what happened and so really what we can improve in the Ferger for the rare in iterations and I start before at the Remo I want to go down a bit deeper day and show there was a few examples so that that's the electrical power system and I want to summarize again to deliver relevant requirements that are the 10 watts on average that should be produced and the temperature that should be held inside the rover so we had this choice of having the the small one chip solution on the last that was cheap it was easy it was reliable all we could have that more complex system where we have more flexibility we have actually more power output under so then let's mulch it and it's basically adaptable to to what we need exactly and we Indian went for the second second the right option because mainly because the power output because the ten watts imply a few and actually of output and solar solar power input that has to be managed and that's just not possible for the small chip we had in our first prototype actually so we have a concept that was inspired from the Swiss cube satellite because I remember Quentin Reuter for his master thesis and she got inspired from this concept of having this particular architecture that implies having a shared mrs. Huber so we have used three words that that was treated back to your system and directly to that connected to solar panels and the battery and if the the power bus would drop below the shriek or three was it will get regulated or stabilized by discharging the battery or by my solar power but you cannot do this and if it would be to higher than 3.3 volts it will be regulated again with charging the battery and that was basically the main concept and that that he he implemented them and the next steps if you go further would be the component selection the PCB design right those materials right now we're programming the swimmer and testing that that was ongoing and at the same time optimize for having cheaper components components with a smaller footprint so you save space on the PCB and that's on that would be really at the bottom most as we model it right now or maybe a good example that that shows this trade space exploration who saw will be the mechanical design so the driving mechanism that could be what wheels like we have it but it could all be like caterpillar or any any any other kind of mechanism the motors could be cheap ones from either for three bucks apiece or like high-end Maxim motors we all love here intuitively and well you can print that with the 3d printer the structure even the gears you can print them out actually yourselves with plastic we works actually or you could select metallic pipes we have also a few like the one guy for instance we needed to take a metallic one so the in the end we had a combination of all of these things so we had the struts we also have the maximum motors that were sponsored luckily so the prices of you high and metallic one guys as I said 3d printed struts we dip in the rules and in the end it was a trade-off between casts reproducibility reliability the range of the robot as well and the maximum obstacle could give you as well so what we could have done was this this piece map proof matrix or the further points to optimize this design but we figured out that kind of without this we just decided kind of to take one of these options I think so so that there was what we learned from the prototype one and then the second one we had a few adaption so we changed our main microcontroller they changed our model to a standard that is now emerging called Laura and we also added that power system I talked about but mainly it remains the same on that diagram and just just to show you how how we actually are looking at that goal that we are having a rover but it's reproducible by someone this looks pretty much like a kid right it's it's all the three from the Pirates you can just assemble them the solar cells and you know the structure to build the body and looking at this you might you might see that it's not many parts right it's it almost as we discussed within the range of a non complex system that could be managed by one person but in the end for instance the solar panels that are again decomposable in separate parts so we manufacture them ourselves taking blemish cells from ebay putting them into raising and solving the connection so in the end there you have a lot of individual parts of all the parts on the PCB and so on so quickly explodes in in size so the second clones have that more power because of the solar cells and also improve mechanical design so that the wheels will lighter and more stable I also destruct switch on and testify again this summer on a glacier here in Switzerland and to wrap it all up just a few points we we didn't maybe do like an industry or like well like inside in this class so as I talked already about this before we we mainly had this bottom-up approach we also had a global vision at first to define the subsystem later on but we didn't strictly iterate from from top of the model to down down part because sometimes which is saw that great component for instance the earth module that will provide us with power consumption a higher range and was just perfectly adapted for for for our mission so we started this this one and integrated in the design and build the rest of the components around it the there's also of course we didn't have like formal PDI or CDI because we're a small team and also because we're not doing this let's say as a main well yes it is kind of remain occupation but we're still studying next to it and also we may change our design decision on the road not not like the complete design.that minor - things of it and we mainly focus on this approach to rapid prototyping and do a lot of iterations on one thing instead of making first concept studies and then select the best one and only then when you go to like to build it and cut metal less has always said it now that we can do because because we we basically have all this low cost components so it doesn't cost us a lot to build one prototype because everything's true you printed everything is electronic start out is pretty cheaply you aduba right now and yeah we reach scandalous like and to motivate us or to give us some pressure we set these artificial deadlines so we put the design freezes in our calendar so from this point on we will not change these parts of the systems anymore that allows us to have to kind of move on and on this and get get some things often for granted so we don't have to adapt other things because something else changed again and we have to feel that like I talked about in Sweden and on the glacier so that gives us kind of pressure as well because I remember before before the making Sweden we in the lab and we spent the night there to keep the 3d printer running and as soon as there's the progress done put the next one on and you know changing us yeah being doing shifts to to keep it running and that other great experience because you really have that that thing to be balanced because it cannot be depending on train actually so how I structure on the wiki so that's that that allows you to go deeper into the know the different parts and we have trailer for defining humans welcome to the online to Commission free and the major systems engineering challenges I saw here was especially the time management and human factor as well because you kind of need to have this boundary between someone who's been the mechanical design come on who's doing the electronics is them don't cross that boundary because that person is an expert in this field and if you if you just come up with something a why don't you do this with this first of all will annoy the person and second of all it's like that that person has made a lot of thoughts in this and you shouldn't come come with your thing we have done in five minutes ask the right questions and start this difficulties just put the design on paper four components you have yes before so it's just a few minute I like just seconds left for this we go after MIMO as well so we're gonna test miss this Rover Antarctica so we can only send one person to there so we have this agreement with the entire database and they allow us to send one person in February 2016 to Antarctica and it's none of us who's going to go but it might be someone of you or someone else and you have that chance to go there all expenses covered and you will be there as a sign of fuel scientists collaborate with the bases and basically produce a paper at the end of this if you're interested botanical org slash apply you find all the informations there and the deadline is tomorrow actually thank you let's give a hand okay so we have we have like three or four minutes for questions so let's start with questions at EPFL and then one question will go back and forth and just maybe a technical question why did you choose to switch from at your first communication tool along after working we had before or and why before we had a kind of a DIY component that was called hx1 that there you basically had to modulate your own signal the signals that you're going to transmit yourself and it was just way too complex there's a new component you can just send serial command right by you it and it will just do its job and it's higher range as well and lower power consumption and and how you should have coverage in antoshka oh sorry yeah that components only to communicate from the rover to the base so that will be like 20 kilometers for for the coverage to to the lamb where is the iridium and network question this is really interesting things so I was wondering with your focus on openness and affordability I guess do you foresee any participation by the public in terms of like prototyping and testing or even improving the design and/or data enough yeah well we're completely open so we are based here in Mugen no no in a place called echo and then kind of a hackerspace makerspace with everyone I call it we've open nights every Wednesday so anyone can come and all I was designing I just had so if if there's going to be remote collaboration we would really appreciate that so anyone who's interested in a project you can go now let's add a sense of works lest join and we will still be allowed to to collaborate of course no question yeah yes thank you I'd like to ask you a question so you know I think one of the things that was quite first of all the enthusiasm that you guys have is infectious it's very clear you guys are very passionate about this mission and it's very exciting the fact that you didn't do these milestones you didn't do a formal PDR CDR but you're doing essentially kind of spiral development so two questions one is how many more spirals do you think you'll be able to do before you actually deploy the rover because you said you did two spirals sounds like so far so how many more spirals and how will you know whether your mission was successful or not so what are the success criteria in the end when you when you look back at the actual operation how will you decide whether you were successful or not we had our design phase for the last iteration already the truth is we're still adapting some point of it but they're technically we decided on on all the parts and they just implemented it right now and which finding it and correcting a but so that was actually done and we're now building the last prototype or the last actually robot that is going to go there on the thing about achieving our goal so what would what are the the mission criterias that that's done banning the project proposal for the the paper that we're gonna give to our stakeholders so the 30 days or their incident of a second or and so one one part will will be the power and autonomy and also the communication I have a real a reliable communication and one part will be also the scientific payload there will be inside so conducting experiments on the field I think that's something Sam look very concrete goals can we drive a hundred meters per day yes or no can we log every minute everything that every data point that we collect temperature pressure etc can we log that and can we send that to the base like does the 15 kilometer range of the Laura is that a lie or not does that work and of course does the satellite communications work so once a day we will send back a summary of the data and we want to see that that works if we can calculate all the stuff that we want on the rover and if we get that stuff macking anybody at EPFL I just have a question about because it's gonna be I guess situated near base was is there any thought about sort of like how maintenance would work when it's it when it's in operation or if something happens the person is going to be there will be in charge of something maintenance so if something happens if it gets back somewhere you will arrest you and this if some parts they will provide their replacement parts of course so you'll not just sent that finger and like hope it works better yeah we have some backup plans as well we have another question so I was just wondering if you believe if you had follow all what we have seen here in this class about the perceiver is PRS here and so on would you have would that have hindered you and being so reactive or did you feel that you can be reactive while still following all those cause useful your question thank you certain points after of that concept that we have seen not have improved especially the the efficiency in the design procedure so going that that down step by step would would help us to exactly create what we what we defined before and not go too much into
