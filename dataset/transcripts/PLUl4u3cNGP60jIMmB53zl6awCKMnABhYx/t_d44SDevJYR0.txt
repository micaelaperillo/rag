of it the pointy part of the V we're arriving at the bottom of it and the bottom of it is basically you driving down the design and all its glory in all its details and we we call this design definition and then I want to talk about multidisciplinary optimization including what happens at the CDR the critical design review yep go ahead sorry I do have a quick question about a four viz to this do you want a CAD drawing or hand drawing I'm fine with it with a nice dimension hand drawing but we're gonna talk about CAD next weekend so next week so I do think if it would be good to have a CAD drawing and but you know CAD drawings can come in very different levels of detail right so I think it would be good to have an idea at the PDR package most of the PDR packages that you see that have been submitted in prior years at can set they do have a CAD drawing in therefore they're sort of suggested configuration and you know it is useful because you get to see whether the packaging concept really works you know the sketching you can get away with with a lot just sketching so I my answer would tend to be yes but if you know if absolutely you don't feel like you need it or you don't want to do it then a nice hand drawing with dimensions will do as well okay so let's let's talk about the bottom of the V so the other the other thing I'm going to cover today is this idea of multidisciplinary design optimization and so where does that fit in so you remember we talked about concept synthesis concept generation screening and selection and then at the PDR stage we picked you know we picked one architecture so today's topic is really how do you get this architecture which is shown as this square here to an optimal and I put optimal in quotes here because we're gonna argue what that means but you've refined the design such that you can go present it at the CDR so you take this box here which is your concept and you open the box you can see this on the right and you really dive into the details of the various subsystems and components and how they're connected and what you're trying to do is fine tune your design so this is shown here schematically let's say there's a design variable x1 and you want to find where's the optimal point this point here seems to be optimal to minimize metric 3 and and that's the design that you're going to propose so today's topic really is about fine-tuning the design and coming up with a CDR level design that's what we want to talk about and so what I'll cover is our different topics so first of all the NASA view of this it's called the design definition process then I'll talk about MDO multidisciplinary design optimization the use of so called CDF's concurrent design facilities and then finally what happens at CDR so the the general idea of the the design solution definition process is that you start with something like this on the left this is a product breakdown structure essentially your system architecture your system decomposition and on the right side you then translate this to a detailed design okay so for a launch vehicle we have you know the flight segment this is what actually it's going to fly and has a payload element the spacecraft bus and then the launch and the launch accommodation so that's the general ideas you have high-level breakdown but then you need to design every piece you need to have chosen your materials you need to have chosen the dimensions you need to understand the interfaces and for every part you also need to decide what what's a big desk def decision that you need to make when you go to the detail design beside you know material dimensions software what is always a big decision to make when you when you when you do a detailed design go ahead maybe the interfaces between the two yeah interfaces all right what I'm trying to get at is cots who knows who knows this acronym cots let's see it the EPFL anybody know cots what does it mean I think we can't hear you right now commercial off-the-shelf so you have to decide in the detailed design are you going to pick components from a catalog or are you going to custom design these components right and so one of the things at the CDR that I always ask the question so you present your CDR design what percentage what fraction of your parts at the lowest level are cots and what what fraction did you custom design Mike let's you're you've done a lot of these unmanned aerial vehicles and so forth can you talk a little bit about you know what's the typical fraction of cots and how do you make that decision when you design you know a flying thing it really depends on the scale and how robust the the promised cost to the unmanned world is that you can easily go to hobby grade parts and so if you want to get into more the commercial kind of more robust almost like you know almost more like defense kind of like robustness and you know durability you really have to start going into custom design parts because you know the hosts if you can do a whole design in space of you know all the cots parts but you know they're always kind of you know Chinese made electric motors and batteries and none of them that are performed to like you know commercial spec but if your depends what you need from the vehicle so what what you're saying is there's a gap there you can get a lot of cots stuff at the hobby shop level right they're pretty affordable but low reliability or you have really high-end or expensive low part you know Lowe products again like traditional airspace grade right but there's not much in the middle yeah is that what you're saying essentially for sure okay good so you know that's that's the reality of detailed design that you're gonna face and surprisingly in kind of the formal system engineering methodology there's not a lot of guidance on this there's not a lot of you know guidance to say what's the optimal fraction of commercial off-the-shelf parts this is really something you have to work out yourself and depending on what you know whether you're in aerospace or medical devices or automotive or making toothpaste there's actually yesterday that was also a big case study on diapers diapers is a three billion dollar business believe it or not and they they were going for their solution a was to go for a cots solution you know a lot of vendors and then they said no it's just gonna give us sort of average mediocre performance we want something much better so they went for a much higher custom-designed solution took him took him a while to do it but but it was worth it in the end so this is a big decision you have to make so that the point here being at the end you have a very detailed design you have blueprints you have something you can actually build so you know this is a list of all the things you need to do that you define the solution space to develop your alternatives all the things we've already talked about at the conceptual level but you do this at every you know do it at the subsystem level and even at the component level what are the alternate designs cost performance and schedule select your design solution drive it down to the lowest level of detail and then identify the enabling products which would be like support equipment and things like this so the best illustration I can give you why this matters is these two pictures I'm going to show you the top picture that you see here this is a picture that was drawn in the seven to sell the space shuttle program to US Congress this was the vision right this is the orbiter and you can see it's sitting there in this in this pristine hangar right very clean shiny floors maybe four or five people the payload Bay is open there's like one or two carts of ground support equipment you just load up your new satellite close the doors and off you go for your next mission that's a reusable vehicle that's what we wanted and then what we actually got is this you can't even see the orbiter right it's but I promise you it's in there it's it's hidden in that scaffolding so this was the it's retired now but this was the orbiter processing facility at the NASA Kennedy Space Center and the reality was that to turn around an orbiter between flights was almost like rebuilding it and the two subsystems that that required the most person hours of work were the main engine the main engine basically had to be disassembled and inspected and so forth and what was the other system what's that you shield the heat shield the TPS thermal protection system if you've ever seen who it was seen the shuttle close-up okay about half half here at EPFL who's had a chance to see the space shuttle the orbiter close-up anybody go ahead one or two one or two so those of you that have seen it what did you notice about the heat shield did you notice anything about the protection that a thermal protection system who's seen it we didn't we do not hear we're very well here you don't you can't hear me so so the the the point I want to make here is that the thermal protection system every tile is different every tile is a different shape a different curvature and and there were good thermodynamic reasons aerothermodynamic reasons for that but in terms of actually designing manufacturing and turning around the vehicle it was a nightmare right so that it turned out to be not a very reusable vehicle in the end and why because a lot of the detailed design decisions ended up being critical in terms of not really giving you what or not really giving us what we wanted in terms of macro level properties of the vehicle so detailed design really matters did you get that point at EPFL is it clear it okay thank you so here's some I'm gonna not going to go through this in detail but here's some flow diagrams plazas process flow diagrams from the system engineering handbook that essentially describe you know how this works so you your inputs are your baseline logical decomposition models which is essentially your system architecture right and then your your baseline derived your detailed technical requirements you go through all these processes through all these steps and then you end up with a whole bunch of outputs which are more detailed requirements the specifications you remember we teased apart requirements and specifications requirements are what the system should do requirement specifications are how the system's actually been designed right blueprints so that's specifications at the subsystem level and then you get other things like a verification validation plan and then logistics and operating procedures so very very detailed work the other thing that's important is all the design considerations that go into making detailed design decisions so here's a fairly long list of them and you can group them into performance availability this is more related to reliability so you could have a system that height is high nominal performance but is poor right so it's not available very much that's not good we want high performance and high availability that gives you your technical effectiveness and then how do you actually operate the system so operations maintenance logistics so that's process efficiency together that gives you system effectiveness and then of course you have the total cost of operating the system lifecycle costs total ownership cost and then system effectiveness and cost together give you what's called here affordable operational effectiveness so I would argue in terms of the space shuttle program it had high system performance it had okay system availability they had definitely were some reliability issues but it was manageable anybody had very poor process efficiency operations maintenance logistics very very difficult so a system effectiveness wasn't that high and as a result the lifecycle cost was also very high there's a very famous paper where after the shuttle program was ended a life cycle cost analysis was done and it was it turned out that one launch cost about 1.5 billion dollars so during the program people would say oh one launch is maybe 500 million there you know the variable cost and the rest is fixed cost but once the program is done it doesn't matter anymore whether it was fixed or variable cost all you know is what was the total cost of the program how many launches did we actually do and you just take the ratio and it was 1.5 billion dollars per launch of the shuttle and so I would come I would say that's way off from what the original target was yeah Veronica does that number account for for crew and crew training it's it's a good question I think so I think it basically whatever was appropriated by Congress for the shuttle program and I think that would include crew operations as well yeah so I'm happy to point you to that paper actually yes it also accounted for R&D costs as well right yes that's correct it includes everything all in R&D cost R&D took about ten years and then operations was about 30 years okay so you see in and of course you know within within these are budget limits so part of the reason why the shuttle didn't have that high process efficiency was because the R&D budget was capped pretty tightly so rather than optimizing you know for maintainability and turnaround they they said we need to have the system performance we need to have reasonable system availability and then the rest basically is we're gonna deal with it later so that what effectively happened is they capped R&D cost and as a result the life cycle cost ballooned I would argue if they had spent you know two or three more years optimizing you know maintenance and turnaround really making it reusable the lifecycle cost could have been much better but that was not that's not how it worked so you have a lot of these competing requirements and so I want to just ask you this this is the first concept question today okay so imagine you're this is a very detailed design this is of just just a bracket here okay and this this bracket was designed so it has like a tip load think of this as a as a cantilever beam so it's attached on the right side or left side here you have a load and then this is your displacement under a given load and these three brackets all have the same mass they use the same amount of material okay so if we if you can think of this as you get from this very simple design to the more intricate design you have more design freedom so you get better performance you see the displacement goes down but you also have more complexity so it's more difficult to optimize it's more difficult to manufacture and so forth and so we can actually show these three choices here on a manufacturing cost per unit cost versus the displacement structural displacement under load chart so our simple design our one bar design has a displacement of 2.5 millimeters under load and it costs about $2 to make the tube our design has much better performance like 0.75 or something like that costs about $3 to make and then this 17 bar intricate design has 0.6 millimeters so the best structural performance but its cost is about $8 per piece so my question to you is which of these three designs would you select and why so you could go to two to that link enter your answer and then we'll look at the look at the distribution so we have 39 responses that's good interesting okay so one of you said you're gonna go for the super-duper 17 bar design most of you 74% said the 2 bar design and one of you said one bar and then eight of you 20% said you're not sure I guess you need more information right so who picked who picked the 1 bar design the simple design ok so please explain why you picked that well for my application I'm planning on mass producing them and it's for something that doesn't need the degree of displacement that the other ones are doing and so I'm really only seeking to minimize manufacturing cost and the one bar is the easiest to manufacture and also it gives me room down the road to iterate if it's not working so so what would be an example industry your application like a children's toy perhaps where you don't need a very strict requirements on displacement something that your mass producing something mass-produced you know for sort of low low sort of requirement lower requirements okay I think that's a valid answer most of you said the to bar design so who said 2 bars let's see at EPFL anybody who pick the toolbar design sure it gives you the biggest biggest bang for your buck so basically for not that much more cost you get much more sturdy design and as compared for the for the 17 bar one really it's still pretty sturdy but you're paying much less so it seemed optimal yeah so sense right I mean they're all popping but this one is all at the knee of the curve right so you're getting you said bang for your buck or value or you know if you if you did like a displacement or one over displacement I guess per manufacturing cost this one would do pretty well so that's that's a also very sensible answer who picked the 17 bar design a really intricate one who picked that oh I think I might have picked that when I did when I tried out the form I think so I can't remember now it's been it's been already a while ago so so if indeed I was the one so how would I justify this okay so here this this bracket will go on a on the Mars rover this this will go on the Mars 2020 Rover and we need to be the rover will see a lot of different thermal gradients you know it's gonna it has to be very precise because it holds scientific instruments that need to be you know pointing very accurately and even though the mass here is identical but I think we could shrink this you know we we get the best performance structurally for the mass constraint that we were allocated and cost you know this is all taxpayer dollars so well this is a government program so we can spend the money of course I don't I don't mean that really but but it is it is a high-performance application therefore even though the benefit is only small that small benefit is worth it when you look at the whole mission so we're gonna pay we're going to pay for that and we're going to go for the high-performance design you see how that works so I'm the the right answer and I think most a lot of you said you know I you're not sure and it's because who said you're not sure Nathan I said not sure could you don't know all the specifications or what the tolerances are or any other information that would lead you to make that decision right so you know what are the requirements right we don't know the requirements here requirements shall or should requirements if it's a shall requirement what it means is there would be some hard limit here right the the the displacement shall be less than one millimeter if that's a hard requirement then this does this solution falls out does not satisfy and if it's a should requirement then it's a goal that you're gonna trade off the point I want to make here this this lecture is about detailed design this is detailed design right and you're gonna make hundreds or thousands of detailed design decisions just like this bracket and together they're gonna give you you know the performance cost of your over your whole system and and so every detailed design decision you make needs to be informed by the requirements but also the trade-offs between these these properties does that make sense okay so and that leads us and so you you want to make sure you optimize your system you want to make sure you get and I liked Katya the way you said it get the bang for your buck right you want to make sure you don't leave you don't have a lot of inefficiencies in your design so that's what M do is about so let me let me go to M do here what it is so there's a Technical Committee in in AI double-a the American Institute for astronautics and Aeronautics and Astronautics that founder was founded about 20 years ago so it's defined as an evolving methodology a body of methods techniques algorithms and related application practices for the design of engineering systems coupled by physical phenomena and involving many interacting subsystems and parts so the main things you need to do M do are a mathematical model of the system analysis capability and in some cases approximation concepts so what that means is not if you pulled all this together it could be very very slow and computationally heavy so you might approximate some of these things and I'll explain a couple examples sensitivity analysis optimal optimization processes and a human interface those are the main ingredients of nvo who's seen this chart before okay about three or four of you who's seen this chart before at EPFL this particular graphic anybody seen this before apparently no one okay so let me explain this is a cartoon okay and I've experienced this myself working at McDonnell Douglas in the 90s so each of these airplanes shown here is what the airplane would look like if that particular discipline or group could call all the shots okay so let's look at a couple of these so the the controls group is all about controllability so you see that the flight control surfaces are very big now the problem is the linkages you know these control linkages on the outside that's really bad for aerodynamics but the controls people say that's not my I don't care about drag that's I'm just I'm we can make sure my my control surfaces are deflecting appropriately here's the hydraulics group right it's all about the hydraulic pump the filters and and getting hydraulic pressure to all the different subsystems you know the big engine here the powerplant group the engine is the most important thing the loft group loft means lofting is surfaces you're dealing with the shape of surfaces so let's keep this simple so we have a little you know balsa airplane with little straight surfaces very easy for loft production is kind of similar the aerodynamics group wants a very nice high aspect ratio wing very thin very low drag problem is there's no room for passengers or cargo here you see this the stress group they have a nice wing here in the shape of an i-beam I beams are great you know this is good if you're a civil engineer but not so much this none of these things would work on their own so what we really want is something like this right where all these considerations are blended and optimized so we get a high performance system not just high performance subsystem said another way a a high performance system is not the same as just a sum of individually optimized subsystems that's the in a nutshell what MBO is about so one of the readings for today post readings is this paper 6a and this is based on a big workshop we had in Germany about five years ago that's actually longer it's probably seven years ago by now but the paper came out five years ago called M do assessment and direction for advancement and this is a pretty international group that put this together and what we do in the paper we describe the history of multidisciplinary optimization where it is today where it's heading and some of the key milestones so what you see this chart is essentially a kind of history of M do I'm just gonna point out a few things the roots of M do are in structural optimization so that you saw the the bracket with all those so there's actually a field called structural optimization or topology optimization and it's very mature now so you can buy in some of the CAD packages there's some specialized tools for optimizing structures and when you look at it it looks like Swiss cheese with big holes Emmentaler big holes you don't need a lot of structure that doesn't do work for you so it looks a lot of these structures look like webs and and the reason is because the load path has been highly optimized for example if you look at the a380 I don't have a picture right here but you can look at an a380 wing wing spars and and different structures there they're very very they have whole there have more holes than structure because they've been highly optimized so that's the roots of em do starting in the 1960s then I would say in the 80s mid 80s we started having more complex decomposition techniques and I will describe one of these to you today optimization algorithms were started to be built into mainstream programs like Excel matlab mathematica and then more recently you know in the 2000s we had commercialization of multi-level algorithms and the one that I'll describe to you is called bliss so let's talk through a very specific example and then one of those techniques so here's the example of designing a wing and in designing a wing the two main considerations are structural and aerodynamic so here's here's a simplified wing it has a wing area it has a sweep angle it has an aspect ratio and so forth and there's loads acting on the wing as you're flying because of the pressure differential between the upper and lower surface so there's some net force P acting on this wing and as a result of that the wing will warp so you will have some twist angle in the wing and that's just due to the structural deformation so that that twist angle and the displacements in turn will change the drag that the wing experiences so the lift and drag of the wing will change as a function of twist angle but as as the lift and drag change the loads of course then change as well and it feeds back into the structure and in this case what we're looking for is maximum range we want to maximize the range of the airplane and is the very famous this is a sort of simplified version of the range equation the so called breguet range equation and you can see that that the structure influences the range in two ways directly by weight you know the actual weight of the structure enters here twice in the range equation and then indirectly through its stiffness right the softer it is the more displacements the more you affect the drag so what's it's not so clear then what what is an optimal wing is it the lightest wing possible but the lightest wing possible will have a larger twist and may have more drag which will reduce your range right so should you optimize the wing for for lightness or for this minimum displacement or some combination or mix of the two and the answer of course is it's a mix of the two there will be a sweet spot somewhere you know between a very stiff and very heavy wing and a very very flexible lightweight wing there will be some optimal mix of the two and that's that's the key here so let me discuss with you briefly this this this is just one of the methods there are several methods for doing multidisciplinary design optimization but this is one of them called bliss bi-level integrated system synthesis and the general idea here is in this method is that we have a lower level optimization of each subsystem but it's coupled through a system level optimization and what you want is you know an optimal design at the system level not just optimal subsystems so the context here is we're going to design a a high speed a supersonic business jet it's kind of shown in this gray picture and we have four major subsystems we're going to consider propulsion aerodynamics structures and then the performance which in this case is range okay and what's important here in decomposing the problem is the X's and the Y's now the X's are the design variables remember we talked about the design Abel's the knobs you can turn as a designer and so these here are the upper ones we call them local design variables you know like the throttle setting the tail sweep the wing moment arm the thickness of your different of the wings the taper ratio so the idea of a local design bearable is that design variable only is used in one of the subsystems it's local to that subsystem so it's in what you basically can can choose that in each of the subsystems and it doesn't really affect directly any of the other subsystems indirectly yes but not directly and then we have the Y's here the Y's are the outputs from one subsystem to another so drag lift and Z is your maximum load factor your range your specific fuel consumption your wing twist and so forth so those are outputs from a subsystem or discipline that either matter at the system level or are required as inputs by another subsystem and then finally the the last group here are these are known as the shared design variables so the wing aspect ratio the altitude Mach number wing sweep those are those are basically required by more than one subsystem so two three or four in this case then then they're considered as shared variables and they would be treated they would be considered system level variables because they matter for more than one subsystem so this particular what this particular method does is essentially decompose the problem into the various subsystems so in this case again aerodynamics propulsion structures in range and these subsystems are sending this information to each other and are all tied together at the highest level through the shared variables the shared design variables that are that are shared by at least two subsystems so again local variables are only unique to a specific sub system and then for the Y's these outputs internal outputs there's a in between the the Y stars which are coupling variables that are input to a particular subsystem and then the Y hats are coupling variables that are output from a particular subsystem so let's focus in let's zoom in now on just one of the subsystems let's say aerodynamics and see how this works so here was zooming in on one subsystem and that's the aerodynamics and the idea that you can actually optimize just the aerodynamic subsystem by itself so what are the inputs into it we have a aspect ratio wing twist and and W so what is w WR and this is the key to this particular method the W are the weights the weights that you give to the outputs so what you're optimizing here is some objective function f shown here below which is w 1 y 1 plus w 2 y 2 plus W 3 y 3 that's what so you either maximizing or minimizing that and what is this here it's lift drag and the lifted drag ratio so what's really cool about this method is that in addition what it essentially is telling the subsystem is how to properly weight these different outputs in order to optimize the subsystem taking into account the system level objective so the weights are not predefined but the weights themselves are a design variable and so you can see the formulation on the right side so given given Q which is your shared variables the Y stars which are the inputs from the other subsystems and the weights minimize your objective function by varying your local design variables subject to a bunch of constraints okay and so what is what is one of the consequences of being able to formulate the problem this way so this could be a very high fidelity right aerodynamics model compute computational fluid Amyx or it could be what or it could be a lower fidelity code right you can actually as long as the inputs and the outputs are the same you can now plug in you know different fidelity levels of analysis you know something something simple or something based on experimental results you know panel method very high fidelity CFD this becomes very modular the other thing you can do is you can pre-compute a lot of these responses right so for given set of inputs you can pre-compute over a whole range of input variables what the response of that susta subsystem will be and you can store that information and then use what are known approximation methods like response surface models to save that information such that when the OP when you do the full system optimization you don't have to rerun you know the detailed codes every time you can just pull from the approximation you've pre computed already so that's that's one of the really powerful things about this method so and that's what's shown here is you use substitute you have a series of approximation models one for each of the outputs of the system you see that so these these little Wiggly things here are essentially an approximation of that real input-output relationship at the subsystem level it could be an empirical function a neural network a response surface method or you know simplified engineering analysis so you you do a lot of this work offline ahead of time for each of the subsystems does that does that make sense and any questions at EPFL is that is that clear how this works at least in theory everything ix thank you okay so then so what we have now is essentially these subsystem approximations and now we can use them for system level optimization so now let's look at the system level optimization so that's essentially given approximation models for optimized subsystem outputs we want to minimize some objective function so f here in this case which is a function of our shared variables our relevant outputs y star and the weighting factors right that will make the the not the Omegas the W's which are the weighting factors given to each of the subsystems and we of course have to satisfy constraints at the system level so let me show you a example then of what this looks like so here's here's our supersonic jet this is our cycle 0 our initial condition here's the planned form of the jet and I'm gonna show you down here range and just one of the design variables or set of design variables which is our wing box sheet thickness so you go through this and it converges after 10 cycles already so this is what our our business jet looks like after 10 cycles and you know that you see there's a pretty big difference so the fuselage is much longer this by the way is this is same in ships right your speed that you can reach as your max speed is driven by your fuselage length your water length you can see the wings have a pretty high sweep angle this is a this is a supersonic jet and if we look at the details we see that the range here the range is about 3,000 nautical miles and what you see is that it's the exact range that can be achieved and the approximate range merged so the the approximation models that you have in this method are only approximate there's some error and you know as you run the model several times several iterations the difference between the approximation and the actual high fidelity result gets less and less so that it's actually a feasible design and then over here we see the different thicknesses for the inner wing box the mid-span wing box and the outer wing box and you can see that early on and the first four five six iterations things are kind of moving around but then they're settling out and so for this maximum objective of range you can see that the inner mid and outer wings wing box thicknesses are quite different so that's the general idea here is that this result this detail this is a fairly detailed design was produced based on on a system level optimization that included consideration of aerodynamic structures propulsion and so forth so that's and there's several other methods but this is just one of the methods that that's been actually quite quite helpful the the challenge is now in M do in this multidisciplinary optimization are different trade-offs so one trade-off is between fidelity versus how expensive is it computationally so fidelity is over here so high fidelity means you know three 3d finite element model analysis computational fluid dynamics then you have sort of intermediate fidelity or low fidelity empirical models and then on this axis we have just doing trade studies meaning you have sort of a baseline design and you just explore from that baseline design you do limited optimization or iteration or full mdo exploring the full space and traditionally you have to choose am I gonna use a high fidelity models but then I can only look at a few points so then the question is can you do better is there a better solution out there or you can do lower fidelity models and explore the design space very widely and then the question is can you believe the results because you've done this with with approximate models so the real challenge here is we would like to do high fidelity and explore the the full design space so that's one of the big research areas in MDO is high fidelity but also very computationally efficient and then the other the other challenge is quite similar so it's again the fidelity here but then should you just focus on one subsystem how many of the subsystems including you know the financial operations manufacturing considerations so how many of those subsystems do you include in your in your optimization and so you know ideally you'd like to do the complete system but then you you may have to sacrifice on some of the fidelity so that's the the breadth versus depth trade-off okay so any any questions about MD I know this was very fast I do not expect you by the way for for for assignment four or five to do M do on your can set this is really more to give you a feeling for you know how far things have come and some of the computational frameworks that exist to get you to a really fine-tuned optimized design if you're interested in this you know we have the full spring class and you know I I haven't offered this class at EPFL in the past but we actually do offer a distance version with the SDM program so there may be an option to do this at a distance as well well we'll discuss it but any questions about em do what it is how it works at least in principle and it has anybody had done and do kind of work Sam go ahead I just had one question about it if so here we're looking at optimizing on one attribute so it's range but if we have to look at if we have multiple attributes it's still up to us someone to decide how important those attributes are in the end that's correct that is exactly right unless you have a way to combine all these into into one objective function and to be blatant about it to be you know in in the commercial world that's actually clear its profit or net present value so if you're designing a commercial product in a competitive industry you can actually pretty easily combine all this into a long you know as long as you include sort of the key drivers of you know your manufacturing costs if the product is not as optimal and not as performant well probably you're not going to be as successful your market share might be lower so in the commercial world people are doing em do with profitability as the ultimate objective function now for for situations where where you can't it's not about profit necessarily but it's about a bunch of other considerations and you can't easily combine it you can still do utility you can do a utility you know combine it in utility but I agree with you I I think a good practice is then in that case to do the multi objective and then you're going to have a bunch of solutions that are all non dominated right and then it's a human decision-making process to pick among those any any other questions or comments what about at EPFL M do anybody have experience with this before a multidisciplinary dissolving organization okay no I'm gonna get okay that's alright so just just to tell you this is really a big deal in practice so that you know the structural optimization has been around that's pretty standard practice and you know optimizing control systems so we've optimized individual subsystems for a long time now at least two or three decades but optimizing at the system level is relatively new and I think the the best companies the best organizations that are out there they're really investing in this technology and and they're quite good at it and and that's where you can really distinguish yourself from the competition oh let's talk about concurrent design facilities and so I'm actually going to use some material here from epfl because they have a very nice CDF and I want to give credit here to dr. Anton Ivanov at the Swiss Space Center for some of this material and actually one of the papers is also related to this Anton used to be at JPL he worked JPL for close to a decade before going to EPFL so what is a cdf a concurrent designed facility it's essentially an environment where engineers at different disciplines come together to perform you know a system engineering study for a project key elements that you need is the team the process the physical environment which includes the a/v and the software and then also some way to do knowledge management meaning capturing the results of prior studies and ongoing studies and i'll show you some examples of CDF's we also do this in academia there's challenges for doing this in academia a short learning curve you know synchronizing this with the academic schedule and then a lot of turnover of course as students graduate and so forth so there's challenges and in practice what we essentially have is in a CDF we have a set of models that are linked to each other and these models can be for example here's some Simulink models shown here there are some excel models you can you can have cad and one of the tricks is you know to link this together in a way that you can quickly execute different designs and look at the results from that so in industrial settings probably the most famous cdf is the one at JPL at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory called Team X Team X has been around for about 20 years and they just had their there one they just had a bursary where they celebrated their 1,000th study that was done at Team X a typical team X study is about a week so you something you do a little bit of preparation but people work together in the facility for about a week and at the end of the week you have a basically a conceptual design pretty well worked out and the results have been impressive so studies have shown that the cost estimates that team X came up with within 10% of final mission cost for those missions that were actually built and flown so of the thousand studies that Team X did a handful of them actual flight missions but every proposal every proposal that is written starts now as a team X study so it's it's really a big deal the European Space Agency s Tech has a similar facility in in Noordwijk in in the Netherlands and as well all the ISA projects are going through through their CDF so one of these is K ops which is a observe space-based Observatory that EPFL is involved in that project that went through the CDF as well most NASA centers commit and then commercial applications in medical devices painting shipbuilding and like I mentioned in my introduction even consumer packaged goods are now building their version of a CDF such that they can you know very quickly within a couple weeks come up with a new proposal for a product and all the major aspects you know the underlying physics and chemistry the packaging the business case everything is is considered at the same time yes I was wondering why how what makes the cost estimate so accurate with this method so there there there are three major ways of doing Oh Veronica should answer that question since she's getting launched launching on on cost modeling for her research there are three major there are three major cost estimation methods one is bottom-up you know you have the product decomposition you add the costs one is called costing by analogy where you look at a prior mission or a prior product and then you look at the deltas and then the third one is based on so-called CERs cost estimation relationships it's a parametric method you can also blend these and you know I think one of the reasons why it's accurate is because there are two reasons why I would say is you so you always have a cost chair one of the subsystems is costing so you have really people who I've been doing this for a while they know these models and so there's there's some legacy information and the more missions we fly right the more products we make the the more robust essentially these cost estimates become and then the second I think is because people that typically work in a CDF their non advocates meaning it's kind of neutral ground so rather than pushing a particular idea or trying to be overly optimistic you know usually in a CDF the the calculations that are done are pretty non biased and that's not always the case so that's one of the advantages of the CDF as you're getting you know people are trying to say but really let's make it look a little better no no we can't do this because the model says you know it is gonna cost two hundred and eighty million dollars to do the satellite and that's based on you know within prior models and if you overlay different models you know with with some error or confidence that's the right answer so it's it's these two reasons there's experience there's data and non advocacy really are taking a kind of neutral unbiased position so benefits are you know improvements of quality quick turnaround for ideas better cost estimates and then increased creativity and productivity in a company so let me give you a couple examples here this is a CubeSat so this is the ability to design quickly new cube sets this picture here I'm showing you is the Swiss cube that was launched in 2009 still operating I think it's the longest operating continuously operating CubeSat so far there's like over six years of operational data now and so you know for the next generation which is shown here how would you do a CubeSat in in a such a facility and there's three steps you define your decomposition level so you have your system level your subsystem level and then at the lowest level it's called equipment these are the actual components and you have your product decomposition here and then for each of these components you have different that give you either component choices or give you different parameters like mass power with margins that allow you to then choose from this like a menu and pull together your overall design so that's that's a CubeSat example but I want to talk you a little bit in more detail through a design of a suborbital space plane that was done in in that CDF and this was a project known as k1000 so some of you may have heard of the Hermes the Hermes space plane this was a project that European Space Agency had starting even in the 80s and it wasn't built but there was a lot of studies done and this is essentially a Hermes like vehicle but for space tourism that's the basic application and so you know how would you design a space tourism vehicle in a CDF well you have to start with requirements right without requirements you're just it's like you know setting up my analogy for designing without requirements is like taking your ship and going out to sea without a map without a chart with no destination port in mind you're just drifting in the ocean you got to have requirements so here the high level requirements for this particular vehicle level one requirements you have to reach an altitude of at least a hundred kilometers over sea level why is that where does the hundred kilometers come from why is it not 80 or 90 or 150 that's where space is defined right and and what happens to people who go above 100 kilometers they get their astronaut wings they get their weight there get your considered you have gone to space and you get like you know you can claim that you've gone to space if you go above 100 if you don't if you order 80 or 90 you don't that's kind of internationally accepted so that's really where that requirement comes from the second one is zero-g phase you should experience weightlessness for at least several minutes justo a parabolic flight before here the zero-g you know the Vomit Comet anybody well we have to get you guys out there at EPFL are you still with us we are as anybody doesn't but has anybody done parabolic flights of you I know there's a flight campaign coming up right in Switzerland later this year yeah it will be next year I guess but unfortunately no one has done this right now yeah all right guy we have to fix this this is unacceptable I mean this we we have to work on this it's so it's very cool to do these parabolic flights but you only get about 20 seconds right 20 seconds at the top it's like riding a big roller coaster basically and then you go down and then you suffer you know 1.7 G's or whatever then you come back up but we want several minutes and then and then the the next requirement is that the passengers that carries there should be six passengers carried on this vehicle those are the top level one requirement lower level level two requirement safety don't exceed six G+ six GS the vehicle must be controllable at all times so when you're out of the atmosphere you have to be able to control the vehicle that has certain implications the customer experience you should be able to see the Earth's curvature and atmosphere that thin layer at all times the spacecraft's impact on the environment should be as small as possible and then the mass budget the spacecraft mass should not exceed 11.6 tonnes with propellants what do you think that comes from what kind of a requirement is that what flavor of requirement is that you know right so in this case it's actually a piggyback right you're you're either either have a vertical launch and that or you're you have a first stage a vehicle plane from which you're dropped right so that's sort of an interface requirement okay so once you know your requirements you can really start developing your model so here's a here's a model of the essentially the kinematics of the of the vehicle so you have your environment your atmospheric model atmospheric density pressure Mach number speed of sound a gravity model then computing the forces and torques acting on the on the vehicle itself looking at the derivatives integrating that this is essentially the equations of motion of the vehicle in its environment right that it's operating in and then updating that with with a certain time step delta-t so if you can you can zoom in on one of these for example this force model computation of the forces and and there's two frames right there's the earth reference frame and then there's the body centric frame of the vehicle itself so you have in this case the aerodynamic coefficients you have the forces lift drag pitching moment and then you have the actuation this is assume you know the pilots are here in control the rocket engine itself secondary propulsion the rudders and then attitude thrusters you need those especially in you know once you're out of the atmosphere the rudders the the aerodynamic surfaces are no longer effective and we knew this in the 60s vehicles like the x-15 is very famous well it had thrusters that you could you could actuate once you're out of the atmosphere so you know you can go pretty detailed in this so here's a you know you you would then design the vehicle in a particular way you know particular engine wing dimensions aspect ratio a particular flight profile and and then that would be a typical result that you would get in the CDF there's two curves shown here the blue curve is essentially altitude in kilometers so you see there's the hundred kilometers we need to get above this right this was our requirement so we go above a hundred that's good we satisfy that requirement so it looks like a parabola and then we have a we glide here essentially to the ground the whole mission takes it 900 seconds 15 minutes and then the yellow curve here is your load factor your NZ your vertical load factor and you can see that's a little noisier as a curve so we have higher acceleration as we accelerate to altitude and you can see that roughly here roughly in the middle of the parabola the load factor starts to you're basically in freefall you're basically ballistic and the the peak acceleration is about four point three g's here so we satisfy that requirement and the whole reason we're doing it is for this period here that zero-g experience so when the when the load factor goes to zero or near zero that's when you get weightlessness and it turns out for this particular flight profile we would experience 184 seconds excuse me 184 seconds about three minutes of weightlessness this is pretty similar to the flight profile that Virgin Galactic is pursuing by the way so at you know looking at looking at this result you would say well I don't know about the mass here but from from you know reaching a hundred kilometres keeping keeping accelerations below 6g this looks like a feasible profile of course the other thing that we care about is the view right since this is for space tourism we want to make sure that you know that the experience is is great not just from experiencing weightlessness which you can do in a closed can but you actually see something so this was essentially coupled with a with a virtual reality visualization so you can see the you know the landing here you can see you can see these three views here and you can see the vehicle itself has so the pilots are up front and then here's our six passengers every one of the passengers gets their own window so this is the view that you would get from the the front window this is the view from the middle window and then this is the view from the back window okay from that last window here which is closer to to the back to the engines so what would you looking at these pictures you know this comes directly out of the simulation in the CDF what what's what would you say looking at this anything you notice EPFL anything you guys notice look at the view from the front the middle and the back window from the front looks better and yes it will be more expensive at the end for the customer yeah so that's that's exactly what I was what I was asking so it looks like either either you need to redesign the vehicle so that the view is the same more or less from every window or you need to start charging differential prices because clearly right from the back window your view as half your view is obstructed by the wing structure right did you agree with that would you charge different ticket prices for this ride depending on what which seat you get I get that offer and demand supply and demand yes that's right go ahead I could also merit a change in flight plan if your structure blocks the downward view you might want to consider flipping over if like the earth and is what you're trying to see from above so it may have broader implications for the mission okay so me so the the point here is is there wait so operationally improve the experience keeping the vehicle designed the same absolutely but that what that means is you would have to put the operational so the orientation of the vehicle you'd have to put that into your design vector right if you want to change it okay so I I don't know I I think this is pretty cool so you can actually do a lot in this kind of CDF type setting and by the way one of the one of the things that spun out of this project is this company called s3 their headquarters are in in PI Aran and Switzerland this is actually I did a lot of my military service at that airport their goal is not space tourism you see there's no windows on this vehicle but deployment of small satellites custom deployment for small satellites with a reusable vehicle so it's you know I think it's a very interesting concept but the question is is it feasible right is it feasible the aerodynamics the economics structurally engine reuse there's allotted this is a great picture but you know the devil is in the details so really working out the details of such a design that's what a CDF is for and you can really go deep ok so any questions about this I'd like to do a little partner exercise here any questions so let's do a partner exercise and I want to the question is what are your experiences with concurrent design facilities so far whether you've you know done an internship at ISA or JPL or some other place that has a facility like this or even if you if you haven't been there kind of speculate and discuss what it would be like you know which may be you know what would be your favorite chair would you pick propulsion or costing or or flight trajectory you know just sort of speculate and discuss with your partner so for which project or application did you use it what went well what did not well what could be improved and if again if you don't have much experiences just think ahead what it would be like what would you like to get out of it if you have no experience in it so there is it either a concurrent design facility and I was talking with katie a-- that maybe also united nations can be considered like the the the facilities there can be considered a current design facility I don't know if it works this approach do you mean in Geneva United Nations in Geneva or London or New York yeah I mean in general exactly but do they actually have a physical facility with models and screens and are you are you saying this more metaphorically what metaphorically more okay but you know I think go ahead and we're referring to the layout to the to the fact we were looking at the ISA layout you have one big room where you have all the people coming together all the different models coming together so that's like all the different experts we have sub rooms for different project rooms and then you have like a big conference room it's kind of the structure of the layout of the facility but you know maybe a place like the UN could really benefit right when they when they deal with a refugee crisis or with you know a change negotiations it's I like this idea great great suggestion what about here at MIT any any experiences thoughts yep please go ahead yeah AFRL we have a rapid innovation officer he's like a general equivalent as a civilian Alok das and he basically is cast with breaking all the rules in AFRL whereas most projects take years to complete he fields questions from the field from the theater from war fighters and they have an urgent need and he gets them a solution in under 12 months so he pulls in all these experts from industry academia wherever he'll lock them in a room and they don't leave until they come up with a solution and he has the money and the influence the backing by the AFRL commander to get it done and what does that I mean if you can share roughly what does that facility look like roughly does it have like models and computers and screens or nothing just white walls what like the white board walls and they will just be covered with everybody's ideas by the time they leave there oh I say so it's it's not as much a computationally supported it's more of a human process cool okay great interesting any other other experiences anybody been at JPL or seen a commercial facility in a commercial company that does this kind of work please go ahead yes well it's less than the commercial I was working at I was interning at the Aerospace Corporation this past summer and I was working in there concurrent design center and it uses a similar a similar laid out layout as JPL team X is design where it's basically using models that they have like a group of engineers who sit at desks and there's multiple engineers per subsystem and they just discuss they're given a mission objective and they discuss how they can best design the system based on that and they model it and optimize it in the subsystem and then they feed it back to a systems level did you participate in that oh yeah so what was what what did you think of it it uh a lot it's a lot to take in at first just I'm trying to understand how each of the models work um you're not necessarily supposed to work for each model and use my each model but as an intern they wanted me to like kind of see what each of the models would do and how the not necessarily exactly how the optimization techniques work because I didn't necessarily understand it but just more of have an idea of how it actually works as a whole okay good anybody else at EPFL want to share any experiences apparently not but it just just a problem with the Sun we didn't hear anything on what the game before just told us okay did you push the mic okay so basically he worked let me try to summarize he worked at the Aerospace Corporation he interned at the Aerospace Corporation was it in Virginia or California California in California and Aerospace Corporation is like a think tank and it was it was very similar set up with different subsystem experts different models and justice was saying one of the big challenges is so much information right taking it all in and understanding all the models and coupling and so forth so it and and I agree it takes a while if you haven't been working in this environment it takes a while to really get used to it so the last thing I'll say here is that we well two things one is when they're linked one is that these CDF's are not cheap if you really want a high functioning cdf you have to have people that are dedicated to this you know the software licenses expire the the technology gets old you need to cannot just use it but you need to constantly refresh a CDF keep it up to date and it just doesn't happen automatically you got to have budget for that you have to have people who are dedicated to updating the models updating the facility and so forth so it's it's definitely something that that needs to be invested in on a regular basis so what happened to us here at MIT in air Astro when I you know when I first eve actually went out when I was sitting where you were sitting as a grad student we had we created a CDF in the mid-90s and you know it was just like the one at JPL we had desktops you know with labels thermal propulsion and we used it quite actively for maybe five six seven years but we didn't put the budget into it every year we didn't have a dedicated person who was really looking after it so what happened to our CDF is that entropy took over right and it sort of got more and more dated and when you go and look in this room now it kind of looks like a regular conference room so all the desktops that we had are gone I guess they'd be pretty old by now and there has been a pretty strong debate among the faculty whether actually we need this should we recreate one and the argument goes as follows the proponents say that a CDF is really something special it's everybody when you enter in the CDF you know this is a special place this is a facility that's designed specifically for doing rapid studies all the information you need is there the walls are plaster with reference information you know it's it's a it's it's really that's what it's for the counter-argument is that this is no longer the mid-90s now everybody has laptops everybody does mobile computing all the models and data should be on the cloud right not sitting anymore in a dedicated server facility but it's sitting on the cloud and therefore you know physically a facility that's dedicated is no longer needed what you do is you get together in a more kind of flexible ad-hoc way everybody everybody brings their laptops you have the big white walls like you said and you can just create a CDF on-the-fly right everybody brings their computing resources stuff is on the cloud and therefore and then you get a lot done and then you disband again you clean the whiteboards and you're done therefore no longer needed a dedicated CDF those are the to counter kind of veiling countervailing opinions right now my view is I think a CDF still has value today I think it is it is valuable for as a dedicated facility but it needs to be updated so yes the models should be on the cloud yes you can bring your laptops but it is still valuable to have dedicated computing resources again so I I now think a hybrid model is actually the right way to go so we'll see where it goes but it's an it's a pretty active debate they've also been you know theses written on CD f's comparing different CD f's and so forth so take a look at at the on tone even off paper in the reading and and just think about this this is I think this is a big deal and it's it's going to be even more important in the future whether you're doing space missions Aeronautics whether you're designing commercial products you know or in the military these facilities that allow you to make these design decisions in a very interactive very quick way are going to be more important than the future and this is this is a big part of system engineering any any final thoughts on this before we move on okay so lesson here's some lessons learned from the EPF if EPFL CDF so this is a particularly in the university environment so you know giving access to a wide body of students you need to adapt this to the University schedule the learning curves the analogy of a smoke-filled room or war room optimal team size you know a CDF with 50 people on it is not as effective as one with you know seven plus or minus two and then distributed CDF's they don't typically work as well so I almost wore my I have I have a shirt that's almost the same this is anybody know who this is or where this is from this is Sheldon Cooper right and the Big Bang Theory his virtual reality presence so the point here is that virtual reality is is okay so you can come you know you can you can imagine a CDF where half the people are in the room and half the people are dialing in remotely but it's never quite as good as everybody is is there physically so human interaction is critical okay the last last thing I want to talk about today is the CDR this is a big big milestone this is a very big deal the critical design review the main purpose of it is to approve the final design in all its glory in all its details so generally the way we talk about it is if you pass the CDR you got the green light to quote endquote cut metal of course you know our our systems have software and hardware and so the the cut metal is a is essentially a euphemism for you can go ahead and manufacture the system now CD ARS are typically the biggest review the most largest number of people you will have at the CDR you know if you have if you had 10 people at the SRR and and 20 people at the PDR you're going to have fifty or a hundred people at the CDR because any question that comes up on any of the parts say is this really right well what are the impact of this detail on the rest of the system somebody should be there who designed that part or who can answer the question at least so and CDRs are typically longer than one day in fact for a big project a CDR can be a whole week of review so people it's you get really tired big CDR czar very very detailed you really have to drink lots of coffee and stay awake so here's the description of what a CDR is one of the guidelines is that approximately 90% of the engineering drawings are approved and released so it's okay to have a CDR if you have not a hundred percent of everything done but you need to have at least 90 90 percent complete you can't do a CDR with you know half the drawings done and it happens at the end of phase C the final design phase C for very large projects you can have sub CDRs so those major subsystems you'll have a system level CDR and then you can have sub CDRs for every major subsystem in your in your project so an example I put a link here this is from late 2014 the CDR for the James Webb Space Telescope that I mentioned earlier they passed the last major element level critical design review which was which was a big deal so launches is planned for 2018 but it doesn't for big projects what I'm trying to say is there may be more than one CDR then maybe the master CDR for the whole thing and then subsea dr's for different subsystems now if you don't well let me get to this on the next chart yeah go ahead oh the like CDR slides for NASA projects it was available anywhere as a public entity or in can get access mmm it depends it depends you not always because especially if commercial companies like you know Lockheed Martin or somebody is is doing like the spacecraft bus they would consider those details proprietary so in general I would say no but four four can sap actually you can four can't you probably already found them four can set you can actually find a lot of this so prior PD ours and CD ours you can you can see that I I encourage you not to look too much you know you kind of want to come up with your own thing but you know for for projects that don't have a commercial interest or proprietary technology it's often available so he to show you just this is a table from the handbook page 178 this is the entrance criteria and the exit criteria for CDR so entrance criteria means what do you have to have in order to be allowed to go forward with a CDR and that's mainly three things successful completion of the PDR and responses made to all the PDR rfas and rids our phase and rids are essentially deficiencies open items that came up in the PDR so you have to close them out a CDR agenda and then number three is all the technical work packages and so we see it's a huge list here baseline document specification fabrication assembly and integration technical data package acceptance criteria verification and validation plan launch site selection and operations plan super super super detailed this is a lot of information and at the CDR you're going to go through all this so you can imagine what that means and then success criteria on the right is you know you this in order to successfully pass the CDR these are all the things that you have to basically have you have to have approval for all these things now in reality just like at the PDR at a CDR there will things things will come up that you missed or that people have concerns about and so you will you will make a list of those and then you have to address these action items coming out of a CDR if if those action items are serious and if they're really serious you could fail the CDR and say you know with this this is not going to work you you this looks it's we should not proceed and they send you back or they cancel the project that's happened also more likely is that they'll ask you to do a so-called Delta CDR so they'll they'll have you you know it's like we taking an exam or something they'll have you come back and you'll have to do a CDR again but only on the Delta the portion that that raised concerns at the main CDR you don't have to do everything again that's called a Delta CDR ok any questions about CDR this is really the this is the big one this is the big milestone and obviously if you know you're the concept or the architecture you chose at the PDR turns out not to be a good one it's very difficult to make changes to that here right this you're kind of locked in to whatever a design or architecture you chose at PDR that's why PDR is also so important even though you have less detail yep Sam go ahead do you have to have contracts in place already for the like manufacturing and operations and absolutely active I mean basically greenlight CDR the next day you start manufacturing so you know every portion of your all the components all the manufacturing all of that has been a bid selected contracted everything's in place contractually absolutely ok any any questions at EPFL about CDR who has actually gone through a CDR on your end has anybody done a CDR for any of the projects okay go ahead I did also a CDR because I had DR last time at the Rex asbestos program and one comment I want to make so if the teams were allowed to fail the PDR and still fly if they fail the CDR then they didn't fly at all so it was very strict and demanding yeah so would you say that the CDR is more strict than the PDR the CDR is more strict yes I agree I agree definitely okay any anybody else is it are any of you working in in systems other than aerospace like I don't know medical devices or you know scientific instruments so so the reason I bring this up is because in you know medical devices medical devices have to be approved by in here in the US it's the FDA the Food and Drug Administration and then in Europe there's equivalent you know European level thing it's it's very very detailed it's really not that different so presenting your medical device design to a panel of experts doctors you know people in systems in medical safety regulators it's it is like a CDR you basically are going through a CDR when you're trying to get your medical device approved for sale and use so it's not not often called a CDR but it effectively is a CDR so this this is this is in especially in industries where there's a lot of money at stake and people you know safety people's health is at stake this is this is common practice okay so let me summarize here so this is the detailed design phase we discussed it's it's very important basically you take your PDR level design and you go define all the details in full maturity you create design documents and models and you know as we talked about last time there's we're sort of in this transition phase of producing documents verse producing models typically we have both now examples would be detailed bill of materials computer-aided design files we'll talk about CAD next week computer-aided design software in control system definition user interfaces etc etc etc multidisciplinary design optimization is is is a very powerful concept to optimize at the system and the subsystem level and trade-off between disciplines and objectives the CDF's are the concurrent design facilities and they've now become standard practice both in aerospace and product product design companies if you have not had the chance to experience and work in a CDF I really encourage you to do this it's I think it's a life-changing experience it really it's it's not easy because like you know justice said there's a lot of information to absorb but once you've done this and experienced it you realize if you don't have a CDF if you don't design products this way you really should and then CDR is the big milestone the last gate before quote endquote cutting metal you
