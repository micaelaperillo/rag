many of you have heard of mukes uh they're very famous massively open online courses muks are very uh open and large classes often with thousands or tens of thousands of participants and muks are essentially um a big movement to really Dem democratize education Sparks a little different so 1684 842 was run as a Spock which stands for small private online course so like a moo a Spock is also offered online you can take it in person in a classroom at one of the hosting universities uh or you can take it entirely online it's it's really up to you it's small because we have a few dozen students instead of thousands and um it's private because in order to take the class it's by invitation in this particular instance we had two universities that co-sponsored this class one is MIT and the other one is called epfl E po technique Federal de Loan in Switzerland which is also quite active in the in the world of online education the way fundamentally that a Spock works is that you have the course management system at each of the hosting universities and institutions and you essentially post the same materials the lectures the readings the exercise is you post them in parallel at each of the hosting universities the lectures themselves however are Run online using you know an open collaboration platform like WebEx for example you can do it with Google Hangouts there's a lot of different platforms and this is important because um it is important to have live connections between the faculty and the students but also the students amongst themselves can discuss the trickiest part of running a Spock of course is the time zones and the time differences in this case uh the two universities were six time zones apart and so it was offered in the morning here at MIT and in the afternoon in Europe if you're running this as a global class it will be more challenging to find a time slot that works for everybody the feedback from the students uh has been very positive because you can think of a Spock in this particular class as a blended form of Education part of the class is live the lectures are given live and every lecture is recorded so even if you miss a lecture as a student you can watch it later and so there's a record of it uh the assignments are asynchronous and there are some assignments that are individual and there are team assignments as well and so it's a blended form of Education which is an important Trend in education where we take the best of the online experience and we try to combine it with best the best of the in-person experience teaching a Spock is uh fun and challenging at the same time it's fun because you get to converse and um interact with students not just in a physical classroom at one University but across multiple institutions and um and and that enhances the class because students will speak up with experiences from different cultural backgrounds uh but it's also challenging because you have to keep track of what's happening at uh at multiple places and you have a mix of students from from from different backgrounds and uh different you know institutional uh constraints as well and so it's both challenging and fun but it's a very focused experience and the the feedback from the students has been great
