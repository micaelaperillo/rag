the personal reflective memo is a two-page document that I ask the students to write at the end of the class but before the oral exam so all the lectures we've had all the team assignments and all the material has been presented and at this point this reflective memo asks the students to think back on the material what really uh was the most important thing they learned uh what of what they learned in the class are they going to build into you know their own future projects their own careers if they're interested in systems engineering as a career choice whether it's in research or in Industry why is that the case and so they submit this uh one or two days before the oral exam and so we have a chance to to read those reflective memos and usually one of the very first questions in the oral exam is about some key ideas that they presented in their oral memo so it provides a great hook uh into the oral exam
