concept questions are a fairly recent um instrument for checking the understanding of students in real time during the class one way to administer concept questions is using clicker systems and they've been around for several years a concept question is typically a a very short question that requires either reflection or some very simple calculation that can be done in less than a minute the concept question is intended to surface misconceptions but also alignment and understanding and you know I do administer the concept questions using um in this case Google forms but you know there's other ways to do it essentially providing the students a very short URL a link that they can enter um either on their laptops even on their smartphones or on their tablets and usually a concept question is a multiple choice question sometimes it's very easy sometimes it's quite tricky and I give the students about 30 seconds or so to to think about it work out an answer respond online and then I display once uh once the answer period is over I display the responses in real time and what's nice about it is in the context of the Spock it doesn't matter where the students sit whether they're with you in the classroom whether they're online everybody has the same link so you're getting everybody's responses at the same time so it's a great mechanism for engagement sometimes everybody agrees 100% or 90% agreement everybody chose the right answer and in that case there's not much discussion needed because it's clear that uh it clicked you know the concept is well understood my favorite concept questions are the one where the the answers are all over the map you know you have five possible choices and each of them got close to 20% that's great because now you have a hook for discussion um so I would then if that happens I would spend the next three four five minutes in the class reiterating the concept and then asking students who voted for a who voted for B why did you do that what was your opinion um and so you get a great discussion going which again can have the in-classroom and then the online component as well we also use the chat during those uh post uh post concept questions and it's a great way to activate it and there's a second uh reason I also do concept questions at least one during lecture which is it's a great way to track attendance uh and I I'm upfront with the students about this because you can see the time tag when students responded so you know exactly who responded to the chat during the class and um I I do use that for um for participation grading
