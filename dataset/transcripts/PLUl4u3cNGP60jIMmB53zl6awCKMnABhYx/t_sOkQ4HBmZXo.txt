Um so we're starting to really make a lot of progress here moving in the V model. Today's topic is uh session five trade space exploration concept selection and PDR preliminary design review. So there's a lot to talk about and I'm going to go relatively quickly through this. So first I want to talk about decision analysis. Fundamentally uh when you come up for a PDR you have to make a big decision which is what concept are you going for? What is your system architecture? That's a big decision. You don't have all the details yet. The design is not fully done but you've chosen your key architecture. That's a big decision. And there's a whole branch of research and science called decision analysis. So I want to tell you about that. uh talk about some of the issues in concept selection and then give you some tools for doing that in a kind of organized way. There's a couple of what I would say simple methods uh pew matrix and multi-attribute utility that are relatively I think straightforward and then there's a bit more um kind of advanced uh concept called non-dominance uh PTO frontiers getting into multi-objective optimization and so at a minimum when you choose your concept you want to choose a non-dominated concept and I'll explain what that means and then we'll close with discussing what is is a PDR. What do you do with the PDR? Uh what's the purpose of it? So here's here's a uh another way to explain essentially the flow of things uh as as we um come up to PDR. So the way you can think of it is you start with a need right and your requirements. Uh that's we've talked about that before. And then you have this creative phase which we talked about last time, right? You come up with a lot of ideas, a lot of concepts and uh and the funnel that you see here is is going up. So the each of these shapes here, the the the circle, the triangle, they're meant to represent fundamentally different concepts, different architecture, different way of satisfying the requirements. And so there's a lot of different things you could do. and the funnel opens up. This is the sort of the size of of of options or alternatives you're considering. And then you you have to you have to filter this down. In the end, you can only build one system, right? You have to choose one architecture. And this filtering down happens typically in two steps. One is uh what we call concept screening which is more qualitative. Okay. And then uh the actual concept selection is more quantitative based on models. based on data based on on on metrics and then you arrive at PDR. So in this in this sort of simplified view we've chosen the square right as our concept and we've made that decision by looking at at the different metrics. So you can see that on this on this graphic up here we have metric one metric two. You can see the triangle is dominated right the triangle doesn't do as well if we want to maximize metric one and two. So it wouldn't make sense to choose the triangle but the circle and the uh the square uh circle does better on metric two but less well on metric one. The the square does better on metric one not quite as well. And they cross over at some point. So whatever how you weigh this in decision-m the decision is made we're going to go for the square that's our concept and then you move to the actual system design postPDR which is uh all the details so we're expanding the box now the square and designing all the details within the structure the avionics the software the controls and uh net's design modeling and optimization and so here I'm showing you metric three which is maybe another metric and then design variable X1 which is some pretty detailed uh decision that you make within that concept and you're looking for the optimal in this case minimizing metric 3 it's this point here and then that gives you your and I put this deliberately in quotes optimal design that's what you show at the CDR and the critical design review and that's what you go and build so that's roughly the the flow of of decision- making any any question about that that general flow. So what we'll talk about today is essentially this portion here concept screening and concept selection. So um since you make a decision uh what is decision analysis? So decision analysis in general is methods and tools for ranking and choosing among competing alternatives or courses of action. And I just want to make um the word alternative. A lot of people use the word option and alternative sort of as synonyms. They're not okay. They're not. Options and alternatives are not the same thing. An alternative means if I choose A, I can't choose B and C. But the fact that you've chosen A or the square or whatever your concept is means that uh you cannot choose the other ones. An option means well given that I've chosen A, I could also add something on top of A. Right? It's kind of like if you're buying a new car, are you going to get the winter package or not? That's an option, but you've chosen, you know, a particular vehicle. So, so that that's important. So, alternatives are mutually exclusive choices or courses of action. So, you need the alternatives. Those are the components, four components of a decision. You need criteria which means how are you going to evaluate uh and compare the alternatives. Then you need value judgments. You now apply the criteria to the alternatives to compare them. And then finally you need a decision maker which is either an individual or a group with preferences to then make the choice. Okay, those are the four ingredients of decision analysis. And if we show this somewhat graphically, so here's our alternatives. we can do a b or c. Uh the criteria in this case are cost, performance and risk. Then we we basically evaluate uh in this case option or alternative a I should say for cost for performance for risk and and this gives us some score or number and then we need to figure out a way to combine this to uh rank the alternatives. And when it comes to ranking, there's a distinction between what's known as an ordinal scale and a cardinal scale. So in an ordinal ranking, all you really care about and do is say what's the best choice, the second best choice, and the third choice. You've ordered the alternative, but you don't know in an ordinal ranking or ordinal scale whether you know one and two were really close and then there's a g big gap between two and three or uh you don't know that and you don't really care. All you want is the rank order. Uh when you when you put things on a cardinal scale, so this is a continuous line, you actually uh get in a sense both the order but you also see how close the alternatives are. So that's a cardinal scale as opposed to an ordinal scale. Okay. So yes, please. How do you get like a discrete value for something like risk or something like that or and especially when an ordinal scale if you have two things that are really close to each other but the risk is kind of a blurried region. How do you So then they would be equivalent in terms of that criterion and uh you can actually have ties, right? You can have alternatives that are tied and and I'll talk about this is one of the issues in concept selection is how do you do tiebreaking? Good question. Any any questions at EPFL? I know this is very abstract but fundamentally that's what we do. Any any questions over there? Is it clear? Yes. Okay, good. So let's let's keep moving. Uh so what are the issues? I think that's So multiple criteria, how do you deal with them? We usually have multiple criteria. And how do we and and eventually when you make a decision, when you pick a concept, you're somehow combining these criteria into a single measure, whether you're doing that explicitly or not. So how do you deal with these multiple criteria? We'll talk about that. Here's your the point, you know, that you brought up. What what if there's ties? How do you break them? uh group decision making versus individual decision making. Who gets to really make the decision, right? And uh and this relates to the stakeholder analysis. Who has the power to make the decision in the end? And then uncertainty. Uh did we choose the right criteria? Did we evaluate uh each option properly? And then the big one is are the alter are the best alternatives represented? So you can choose among A, B and C, but maybe there's this much much better architecture or concept D out there, but it's not in the decision set because it didn't nobody thought of it or you know some other thing happened and it didn't come up in concept generation, right? So there's there's a lot of uncertainties when you're doing this. So you have to be aware of it. So let me uh talk about uh two again quote andquote simple methods for doing concept selection. The first one is called Q matrix and then I'll talk about utility analysis. So the Pew matrix essentially is a very uh discrete method. It uses essentially plus 0 and minus to score alternatives relative to a DATIM. A datim is a reference decision, a reference architecture. And this is named after Stuart Pew, who's a British um who is a British um professor of design essentially. And it's it's a very simple method. Uh and it's used extensively. Uh it does have some pitfalls as well, but it's it's very well known. So, uh Pew matrix. And then the second one is called utility analysis. So it essentially maps all the criteria to a dimensionalist utility. Uh this is between zero and one. So zero is a completely useless system. It has zero utility and one is a system that has perfect utility. It it can't really be impro you could try to improve it but your satisfaction would not increase. Okay. uh and this is this has very deep mathematical uh theory particularly the von Noman and Morgan Stern um utility that um that uh that was was basically uh developed in the in the mid 20th century. Anybody seen the movie A Beautiful Mind? Yeah. What uh what is what is a beautiful mind about? you uh it's about John uh the mathematician John Nash who was an or a mathematician who won um uh I forget exactly what prize he had won um I thought the yeah um he won the Nobel Prize was it the Nobel Prize okay um game theory for what for game theory right and so so the one of Nash's contrib contributions was the idea of a Nash equilibrium. So we have multiple decision makers in in gaming and the question is uh you know you have your current strategy but is there a better move you could make and if if if you could make make a better move that improves your your uh satisfaction or your utility uh but but by doing this uh you decrease somebody else's utility you may not you may not go there. So if you reach a Nash equilibrium, it means that everybody believes that this is the best they can achieve. And and how do you measure that? Well, Nash actually uh developed his Nash equilibrium and gain theory building upon theories from of fun uh von Noman and Morgan Stern. So there's there's very deep theory behind it. I'm not going to go very deep into it, but so you know that that there's a lot behind utility analysis. Okay. So, let me uh just talk you through the the basic steps for doing a Pew matrix analysis and I I'll show you a very simple example. First step, you choose or develop the criteria for comparison. Um so, you know h how what's important? How are we going to decide this uh selection? And obviously, this should be based on a set of system requirements and goals. Now we there's two flavors of requirements remember what uh let's ask here at EPFL uh you remember the two flavors of requirements what were the two flavors of requirements [Music] two types of [Music] requirements the microphone [Music] I mean there's actually six types right there's functional requirement ments, there's constraints, there's there's um interface requirements and so forth. What what I'm trying to get at is there there are requirements that use shall statements and then there's requirements that use should statements, right? So the shall statements are what what do the shall statements imply? So basically for the sh it's um it's compulsory and for should it's a goal of the system. That's right. Exactly. So in some sense the shell state the criteria associated with shell statements don't necessarily make the best criteria for the pew matrix because by definition the concepts that you're evaluating should all satisfy the shall statements because if they don't they're essentially infeasible right and and you shouldn't se you shouldn't select among them in the first place so so architectures or concepts alter alternatives that violate shall you know shall requirements do not satisfy you know the the must-have requirements and you shouldn't so you shouldn't use criteria that are associated with hard constraints that's what I'm trying to say now the requirements that are associated with should statements those are good criteria for this Q matrix because the degree to which you satisfy this the goals are somewhat variable able. Therefore, you can then compare amongst alternatives. Okay, so that's number one. Number two, uh thank you that was that was good. Uh select the alternatives to be compared. So that those are coming out of concept generation. And one little bit tricky aspect here is when you're uh when you're putting together the alternatives, the concepts to be selected from, they should be represented at a similar level of detail of abstraction. It's it is it's not good to have one concept that's really detailed and you know a lot about it and often it's kind of an existing system or something you've done before and then there's this other concept that is very fuzzy. Uh why why shouldn't you compare something very detailed with something very very poorly defined? Why do you think that's not a good practice? What do you guys think here? Yes. Go ahead. Is it like it's not fair because that's right. It's a fairness issue and because the the concepts that are poorly defined often um you're you're too optimistic about them. That's sort of the typical this looks really good uh very promising but but it looks very promising because it's kind of illdefined. So um so that's important. Try to represent all the concepts at about the same level of detail when you make the comparison. That's number two. Number three, you actually go through and generate the scores. And the key thing here, this is maybe the most important thing about the Pew matrix is you always use a DATM. The DATM is a reference. One of the alternatives that you're going to compare is your reference. So what you do is you always compare every other alternative in the set against the datim and you say for each criterion is it better is it about the same or is it worse than the reference the datim. So you don't compare all the alternatives pair-wise against each other. You always compare against the datim. Then you compute the total scores and I'll show you this in the example. And then there's variations like rather than better, equal, or worse, you could go to uh a five point, you know, much better, a little better, or about the same. So there's some variations on the scoring, but the classic method just uses better, the same or worse. So here's excuse me just a question. Yeah, go ahead. Just about the number three about generate scores and user datam by doing so don't you exclude solution that could have on the general picture be better than others. What do you mean by general picture? If you take all the solution that you have and at the end one performs slightly better than the other but you couldn't spot it uh by using the data. Yeah. So uh it's a it's a very good question and so this is a question of resolution right how good is your resolution the the main purpose of the Pew matrix is not for making the final choice right away the main purpose of the Pew matrix is actually to eliminate concepts that are that are kind of you can tell already that they're they're not competitive and you don't typically do Q matrix one time and then say That's the best one. You use it essentially to eliminate, you know, clearly inferior solutions. Does that make sense? I'm really sorry, but the like the the video got cut just in during your explanation. Okay. So, what let me repeat this. Um so the the purpose of the Pew matrix is not to select the final concept as a result of doing the Pew matrix but to identify inferior concepts to eliminate them from the set. Okay. Okay. All right. So here's a here's a kind of uh generic example uh to explain how this works. So here's our uh PW matrix, our evaluation matrix. On the rows we have our criteria. There could be cost, performance, resilience, uh effectiveness, um and and so those are called A, B, C, D, E, and F. So we have six criteria and then the the column each column represents a concept, a design, an architecture. And so, you know, this we're designing I guess we're designing beams here or levers or something like that. So, this is a solid cylinder. This is a cylinder that's hollow. This is a square cross-section. This is a triangular cross-section. You get the picture, right? They're they're qualitatively different. Uh, and then you know which one is our which one is our reference here? Which which concept? Number seven. Right? If you look at seven, this this sort of uh shallow triangle seven, it says DATM. You see that? Which means that this is our baseline, our reference, our DATM. And then what you do is as you fill this in you, so for you and and you can do it two ways. You can do uh pick say concept one the the solid cylinder and then compare it against seven for all criteria. So A, so concept one is better than concept 7 in criterion A. So it gets a plus. It's also better in B. It gets a plus. It's worse in C and D. So this is a minus compared to seven and so forth. So so the two ways of filling it in is you do concept by concept, column-wise, or you can do it row-wise, right? And there's there's some arguments in favor of one or the other, but essentially you you fill in this matrix by um by always comparing against number seven. Alexis, what's your question? Yeah, just a question. Should shouldn't we wait the criteria? I mean that if for example, if the criteria A is more important, should we put more weight on it? No. No. At this point, at this point in the Pew matrix, the criteria are unweighted. This is very important. You don't say B is twice as important as C. They're unweighted when you when you first do this. Eventually, when you do the final selection, you will probably weigh them. But when you first do this, there's no waiting. They're equal. Okay. Yes. Go ahead. Uh, are there any rules in picking your datam or do you just arbitrarily? So, I'll get into that. Um, you it should be a it should be a a design that you think is competitive that uh maybe you know it you know it maybe it's an existing sort of system with data on it uh kind of a a known quantity but if you don't have if you don't have any information if they're all equal then it's a random choice. Okay. So uh then once you've filled in this matrix so s here is for same right same about the same then you essentially sum all the pluses you sum all the minuses and then you have the net sort of the net result unweed right so here you can essentially compare that you can see that you know concept one is better in three and worse in three than the datim um you can see that uh you can see that um concept two is inferior in three criteria, better in two, and the same in one. But we're not actually summing. We're not actually summing at this point because we we're not waiting these. Okay. But it it gives you a basis of understanding. Okay. So, let's do a quick uh partner exercise. um what do you see as the main advantages and potential disadvantages or pitfalls of this method? So turn to your partner, discuss this for a few minutes and then we'll we'll see what you came up with. So it's a really it's really an unweighted method and it's your primary selection to eliminate uh that you know what to eliminate to simplify your convergence and not the it does not select your criteria or select the concept just to know what is falling out anyway to simplify the method. Okay. [Music] All right. Uh good. So uh let's uh let's see advantages. Let's get a couple here and then we'll sort of go back and forth uh between here and EPFL. So what are what's good about this method? Yes, go ahead. So I think Nate and I were talking that uh it is a relatively simple decision-m process. So instead of just going with some sort of gut feeling or not looking at everything, uh you can get stuff down on paper and actually see these criteria and how they relate to each other. Yep. So simplicity. What else? Go ahead, Sam. Uh, it allows you to look at a large array of concepts very quickly. Okay. Large U samples. That's not a great Sorry, that's quick, right? You said quick. Okay. Uh, what advantages EPFL? What did you guys come up with? So simple. It allows you to look at a lot of concepts. It's quick. What else? So here at TPF we we got um basically the same things but this method is simple and it's pretty fast and um pretty straightforward too. So this is we think a good way to get rid of some of the the concepts uh pretty fast. Okay. Any anything else that we didn't catch? There's one more. There's one I'd like to put on this list. Veronica, go ahead. qualitative kind of like say ideological but you're talking more about conceptual improvements rather than this is better because the requirement is I think yeah go ahead can you just quickly repeat that just that it's qualitative and that you see that as an advantage actually I think you can see it both ways Yeah. So, um I I think what you implied with this is it stimulates discussion, right? Stimulates debate. There's maybe another uh criterion on the positive side. Go ahead. And it would be that it's extremely easy to explain to NASA or to Issa or to whoever your customer is because uh and they can relate to it as the criteria are mostly physical or scientific. I mean larger, stronger, lighter, cheaper. Um, it's probably very intuitive. Yes, as you say. Okay, great. Now, downsides. What are the downsides of the method? Go ahead. Make sure you I think it um definitely depends on which you pick as a datim, right? Like if you pick like the the clearly best one as a datim, then it's not going to give you much information. or if you pick like the worst one as a DATM then all of them will be better and you kind of don't really gain much information from that. So you might have to like iterate with different datms. Yes, there's actually research on this. There's some research p this matrix this pew matrix method by the way has been studied like scientifically quite a bit. There's quite a literature on it and the point that you brought up was was studied like for examp they they would basically give the same criteria and the same alternatives to different groups of people but then give them a different datim and it's a little tricky is is is is the result different because it's a different group dynamic or is it but the this has been done sort of statistically and and the d the choice of datim has an impact on the outcome. Very good. That's that's a actually a pretty subtle point that that was excellent. What are some other Yes, please go ahead. While it's very easy to implement and anyone can do it is very subjective. So if you have somebody that doesn't have a whole lot of uh experience in a certain area um they may get a completely different answer than somebody who is an expert looking at the same subjectivity which basically repeatability uh may be low, right? You want to have so robustness of the method such that if you repeated this multiple times or you had gave it to different groups of people, you want to have some confidence that the results would come out similarly. Very good. Uh let's see uh EPFL any downsides. So DATM dependent subjective and what else? Um so what we're thinking is that the the criterias well depend from group to group doesn't seem to be clearly defined what you need although there are some that are straightforward and um our other point dat yeah uh dependence uh if you choose a very easy solution uh or let's say a very bad solution as a as a reference then all the others look good. And finally, if you have a um if you judge on the overall concept and maybe you discard one or two solutions, but inside those concepts, you have ideas that that you could uh keep or use then uh then they might be uh lost. Okay. So, loss of subconcepts. Okay. Okay. Good. Uh anything else here, Mike? Um we were talking about how it's very easy to tune your metrics to be um like to be biased. I see. So gaming. Yeah. Right. Gaming gaming the basically producing a matrix to give you the answer you want that you already had pre-ordained sort of. Right. That that's essentially what you're saying. Yeah. Okay. Uh very good. So I these are all Go ahead. Go ahead. uh uh just sort of one last disadvantage of the method that I think is uh a bit interesting because uh I think the the way grading everything with plus or minus could be a bit coarse cuz you can imagine a system for instance that is very very good in one criteria and then pretty bad in all the others and it could be a good concept but is disregarded nonetheless. Uh what's your name? Uh, Pasta. Pascal. Sorry, Pascal. Is your name Pascal? Mastia. Okay. Uh, keep that point until we we're going to talk about exactly that point when it comes to non-dominance. Okay. So, uh, please reserve. This is great. Uh, just we'll come back to that in a few minutes. Okay. All right. So, this is great. Uh I think you I think you really got it. This is exact this is a very good good list. So so you may say well uh okay this is good for like beams and you know very simple things. So I want to show you an example of a application of the Pew matrix to what I would argue is a fairly complex complex uh architectural decision. And uh what I'll talk to you about is a thesis that was done here at MIT in uh 2003. So a while ago, 12 years ago by uh Brian Smith. He was an SDM student and was one of the easiest students ever to advise uh very knowledgeable in nuclear uh propulsion and nuclear power. He's now the branch chief for nuclear power propulsion at NASA Glenn Research Center in Ohio. And so at the time NASA had a mission that was kind of high priority called GMO, Jupiter icy moons mission. And when you go out to Jupiter and you want to not just do a flyby, but you actually want to, you know, go to different orbits, you want to do high power imaging, you need a lot of power. You're far from the sun. RTGs only give you 100 watts or so per RTG. So nuclear power is pretty much the way to go. But there's a lot of different choices of different nuclear reactor architectures that would potentially uh and then couple that with the propulsion system. So that was the the challenge was you know sifting through the large space of possibility for nuclear electric power nuclear exploration class electric power and propulsion systems. And you know here's the the the way the study was set up is you know the expansion phase, the filtering and then the screening phase. So here's the architectural space the way it was defined. So nuclear electric power and propulsion is what we're after and there's different um ways to generate these alternatives. So the most important is the design vector, the type of reactor, the operating temperature, the power conversion scheme, the heat exchange and then the fuel type. And then there were uh requirements. So this is the power range, the delivery timeline, uh the fact that you should be able to do it in a single launch and then the operational lifetime of the system. So those were the shallow requirements. Every architecture had to meet these requirements otherwise it would not be considered. And then there were some things that was assumed as constants. They're shown here. There was a policy vector in terms of funding profiles, international partnerships, at what altitude you could insert the system into orbit and then influence on future missions. And the objective vector is the criteria for the decision. Techn TRL is technology readiness level. How much infrastructure do you need? Complexity, strategic value to the nation. This is a little fuzzy but basically what this means is could you use it for other applications than exploring Jupiter. Uh the schedule the launch packaging power specific mass which is uh watts per kilogram the uh lifetime. So it's interesting you have lifetime here and here. So there's a minimum lifetime right and if you satisfy this the the extra life you get can actually be used as a as a decision criteria. How does it interact with the payload? Like do you need a lot of shielding? And then adaptability. Can you adapt it for different missions? Yep. The previous slide listed both possible. On the previous slide, we had both possible and feasible on there as different kind of criteria. Um what do you have for kind of a difference for those? So uh essentially possible is you know this is sort of the combinatorial space and then applying the the hard constraints based on the requirements vector gets you from possible to feasible. they satisfy your your must-have requirements, your shell requirements and then you use in screening you use the objective vector these criteria you use to uh go from here to here right so let me show you this uh what this looks like and I'll post this thesis if you're interested it's really the whole thesis is about doing this process um so here we have each column represents a different reactor architecture So and you can see in the legend what what these things mean. So for the reactor type we have a um liquid metal gas cooled or um heat pipe uh type reactor. These are three types of nuclear fision reactors. For fuel we have two types of fuel. If I remember correctly we have U2 or UN. For uh the temperature at which the reactor would be run, we have medium or high. For the conversions, this is the thermodynamics. The how do you get the heat out of the reactor? We have a braen or a rankine cycle uh or a thermmoelectric uh reactor which is basically directly converting the heat to electricity without a working fluid. And then um D is the heat exchange um sort of heat heat exchange architecture which is either direct or indirect. And so you can see that each of these uh columns represents a different uh kind of architecture and they're colored here by you know the so this is d the dark is a direct heat pipe with um uh direct heat pipe with liquid metal reactor and so forth. So that's that's essentially the the uh what you're seeing here is the filtered set that is that is deemed to be feasible potentially feasible and then uh the actual uh screening is done based on on this. So this this is the actual pew matrix here. So we have the um the concept combinations which are the columns. The datam here is the one that's shaded in gray. So it's a liquid metal reactor um with a thermal it's a liquid metal thermmoelect electric reactor with indirect heat exchange un fuel type and a high operating temperature and it the why was this chosen? Well if you look here it says SP 100 reference. So the US actually has launched at least officially as far as we know one nuclear reactor into space and that's the SP100. You can look it up. It it's a there's a history behind it and uh that's the architecture of the SP 100. So it was launched, we had data on it. It's a known quantity. The Russians, it turns out Russia has launched a lot of nuclear reactors uh over the years. Uh but this is sort of the this is sort of the US baseline if you want to call it that. And then all of these other combinations are compared against the SP 100 the the reference reactor. And so you can see here that um that the comparison is drawn against so zero means you know it's it's about uh so for TRL it means it's about equally mature. A plus means it's actually more mature. A negative means it's less mature than the SP 100. And at the end of this, you can actually uh you look at the total pluses and zeros and minuses. And then in this case, uh what Brian did, he did calculate a net score. That's an unweighted score. Basically, uh if you give one point, so let's look at the first one. So it has four pluses, right? It has four pluses and it has five equal to the SP100 to the datam and has two minus. So it's worse than two better in four criteria and the same in five. So the net score would be plus two because it's better in in two criteria net but it's unweighted. And so in order to uh figure out what based on this net score so a zero net score would say it's about equal to to the datim but it maybe in other different criteria uh but but essentially it's about the same. If it's a plus two uh then it is potentially better than the SP 100 but you don't know that 100% because you haven't weighted the criteria. It's really used for screening. So the ones that are circled are uh the ones that are circled are are better essentially than than the datim and the ones that are uh this is I'm sorry the the rank this is the rank among the set. So if you have a one here you're in the in the rank one and there's two two architectures the first two are rank one and then we have this architecture which is rank two. the datim itself plus two other architectures are rank three and then you see that there's some like for example this architecture here is rank eight right so it it why is that because it's not better in any criteria than the datam it's the same in six and it's worse in five right so that gives you an indication that this particular concept probably is is not very attractive and you you would you would eliminate that okay so u that's essentially um that's essentially an application of the Pew matrix to a a pretty realworld complex uh problem. So what the Pew matrix is for is essentially structured structuring and representing the evaluation procedure. It serves as a common visual. It provides some amount of discipline and helps break down uh self-sealing behavior. Meaning what that means is people defending their concepts you know without sort of seeing the bigger picture. Encourages teamwork. It helps you eliminate weaker ideas retain a set of stronger concepts. And then this is interesting divergence. It helps to identify opportunities for combination. There's also a way to use this methrix methods multiple times. And the way you would do this is you would say, "Okay, so these these are the stronger concepts here, right? The ones that do equally well or maybe even a little better than the datim. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each concept? And can can we hybridize them? Can we create some hybrid concepts?" And and so you you eliminate the weaker ones. The surviving concepts are kept and then maybe hybridized with each other. So you expand and create more concepts again. maybe a little bit more detailed and then you apply the Pew matrix again. So it's kind of an iterative application of the Pew matrix where you eliminate you keep strong concepts you hybridize them and then you repeat it two or three times and there's actually research on this as well. Professor Dan Fry who's here at MIT in mechanical engineering has done research on that and shown that uh that can actually lead to very good outcomes. So this this sort of gradual so then the you don't have just one expansion and and contraction of your concept space but it sort of goes multiple times but but eventually it does converge. So this is a more refined application of the method. What Q matrix is not good for is automatic decision making right uh completely controlling the process. So, you know, the idea of of sort of automating the Pew matrix is is should not be automatic and it's not really done. It's not really good for trade studies. Um, challenges. So, here's some quotes. People who have a lot of experience exhibit an impatience. Get on with it. Uh, this procedure holds us back, right? strong-willed individuals who have a lot of experience and whose initial concepts have not emerged in the final selection commence a defensive uh based on emotion, experience and bluster. Right? So there's this social dynamics that gets unfolded here. So therefore it is recommended to do Q matrix with a facilitator. Somebody who kind similar to brainstorming right where you have a facilitator. So you have a facilitator for Pew Matrix. So somebody who controls the flow and pace of the session records the results tries to maintain some discipline compare against the datim. I' I've seen pew matrix sessions where you start with the datim and then by the third or fourth concept people are starting to do pairwise comparisons and the datim is sort of lost that should not happen right uh preventing tangents um but encourage clarific what do we really mean by criteria uh clarification of the concepts and then opportunities for divergence and hybrids so the critique of the method is uh I think a lot of these things you've already mentioned the ranking depends on the choice of datim the waiting you know there's no real waiting in the in the classic method uh however you can implement a weighted version of the pew method but then you have to have the whole discussion about the waitings priori um next I'm going to talk about multi-attribute utility and so matrix and multiattribute utility could give you different rank order of alternatives so how how do you reconcile that uh The most important criteria may be intangible and missing from the list. And my personal opinion on this is that the Pew matrix is useful and simple to use. It stimulates discussion about the criteria, the alternatives, but it shouldn't be your only means of concept selection, but it's usually one of the first things you should do because you learn a lot from doing it. Okay. Any any questions about Pew Matrix before I move on? Yes, Sam. Should it always be done with a group that's I mean working together and and sort of discussing the concepts or could you also have people sort of individually filling them out and then combining the results? So yeah, usually you do it as a group uh because in the discussion with the group uh there's a lot of clarification that happens. Now if you do it separately and you firewall people from each other and have people do this individually and then try to combine the results right later that's actually called that's closer to a method called the deli method and which I'm not going to talk about here but the deli method means you're you're asking these kind of questions to experts you they give you the answers and then you anonymize the answers and reflect the combined answers back to the group and then you eliminate the social dynamics and you can see whether is my was my assessment an outlier you know am I close to the center of the group so the the the deli method has a lot of benefits but it's not usually you you don't have the social dynamic in the same way uh which is sort of essential to make this work good question though any any questions at EPFL about pew matrix before I move on No, it's clear. Okay, go ahead. Is it useful to almost have like an independent group do this as opposed to, you know, everyone generates their ideas and then everyone's trying to, you know, kind of fill out the matrix so that their idea wins? Usually not because uh if you give it to an independent group, they they'd know much less about the problem. You know, they probably weren't involved in generating the alternatives. they weren't involved in selecting the criteria you know they're they're probably not as knowledgeable and so there is there is an advantage of doing it you know within the team but then you know before you actually go and pull the trigger on a final that's the PDR you get that vetted by independent uh people that's sort of that's what happens at the PDR okay maybe one point here is that you can invite uh the external people to join your discussion so you have your design team and it's very good to have the two or three experts to come and sit in the meeting and then give their opinion and with the pure matrix as it's pretty straightforward and simple. You probably shouldn't then bias the result but you could probably enrich it. That's that's a great point. I I agree with that Vulkar. Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. So, let's uh switch gears to uh utility theory or multi-attribute utility theory. So, what's that all about? So like I said, utility is a very uh deeply rooted concept in economics. And so it's defined as utility is a measure of relative happiness or satisfaction or gratification gained by consuming different bundles of goods and services. This is sort of economic very you know this is how economists talk. Uh so it's it's the idea is you want to choose a concept or alternative that that that will maximize your happiness, your satisfaction, your your gratification. And whenever you buy something, when you go to uh Annast Takaria or wherever you guys have lunch or at EPFL, you go to the Rolex Center and you pick from the menu, you're actually doing just that, right? You have, you know, how much money do I have in my pocket? How hungry am I? Uh am I am I a vegetarian or not? That would filter out some menu items right away, right? And and you you pick every day you pick your lunch. Well, you're doing exactly this. You don't really know that you're doing it, but in your mind as you're picking from the menu and then making your choice, you're maximizing your utility at that moment. So, we do this every day. Here in this class we talk about you know designing complex systems. So we we need to sort of do it a little bit more deliberately but but this is not just some abstract thing. We do this every day and and so the idea is essentially we have this consumption set X which are our alternatives mutually exclusive alternatives and then we map that to the real scale. Uh we rank each member of the consumption set. So we map the alternatives on this utility scale in this case the cardinal scale between zero and one. So um the way this is done in order to do the mapping right from the criteria to um utility you need these mapping functions and we call these utility functions. They're called utility functions. So basically we have uh I'm going to use J here for for J means essentially your attribute your objective um and then U is your utility. And so there are different shapes of utility functions and different scholars call them differently. So this is Cook. He says this is smaller is better or larger is better. And you see they're essentially monotonically increasing or decreasing curves. uh Messak another uh scholar in multi-objective design calls this class 1S class 2s. So what would be an example of a uh smaller is better utility function? What would be an example? What would be an example? Go ahead. Go ahead. An example would be like the weight of a launch vehicle that's decreasing the the the launch mass. Yeah. Launch. Okay. Launch mass. Okay. What about EPFL? Smaller is better. [Music] Cost. Cost. Right. So, um, okay. Larger is better. Revenue. Revenue. Revenue. Yeah. Maybe. Uh, range. Endurance. uh reliability, right? Then there's uh the next one is strictly concave or strictly convex, which is nominal is better. So the idea there is there's a sweet spot, right? You want you want the performance or the attribute to be at a pretty specific value and if you deviate from that uh on the up or down side then um then the utility decreases. So what would be an example of that? Size of a meal for example. Size of a meal. Okay. Well, uh there some restaurants may beg to differ. Right. All you can eat. Yes. Noric. Very good. Yes. Sam has to interface with something else. Yeah. So if you there's a very specific interface condition. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. At EPFL nominal is better. Like for example, ambient temperature. Yeah. So temperature, ambient temperature, right? We're humans are pretty uh we have a fairly narrow range where we say this is good. Now we can, you know, put on a sweater or, you know, but but it's a fairly narrow range. So the great example then the next one is range is better, which is uh concave or convex. So this is the idea that as long as you're within this interval within the interval itself you're sort of indifferent right but then when you when you drop outside the interval then utility decreases or increases. And then the last one is kind of very exotic non-monotonic utility functions that have multiple peaks. They exist in theory but in practice uh you almost never see them. I can't give you a good example of a multimodal one, but in theory uh they do exist. Well, there there is one and it's clearly the landing sites on a planet. Okay, because you have you have the one injection trajectory and then you have the primary sites or the primary ellipse then the secondary and uh it's uh non-monotonic mostly that way down doesn't go up it goes down. So you have ideal, then you're out of it, then you would land on rocks and then you have the next plateau and maybe a third one on one pass by. That's an interesting uh that's an interesting comment. Um I'm I'm trying to figure out what what's the attribute what's the engineering attribute that goes with that. U well it's uh the tolerance of on the injection. I know that um at JPL by the way thanks for organizing the visit after I was with you. They made this presentation also of the landing of the rovers and they have the primary ellipse where they try to land. Well try it depends on the on the on the entry and then they have secondary if they if they miss the entry then they have a very bad uh option and then a little bit later they maybe can land on the next plateau or in the next crater which is useful. So they have this uh nonmonotonic uh but degrading function. So first time is best, second would still work, but in between there's a part that doesn't go. Okay. Um got to think about that one. But that that's an interesting uh that's a pretty interesting example. So the the the main point here is that in order to calculate utility, you need a translation function between you know the the engineering or financial attributes of each alternative and utility. It's if it's not if it was directly that you'd just have a linear, right? It would be a 45 degree line, right? Or negative - 45. But but typically the mapping from your attribute values to the utility is nonlinear. That's what this says. So uh so then the challenge is uh well how how do you get these utility functions? Where do they come from? And the answer is you got to do interviews. You have to survey people, the decision makers, the stakeholders we talked about. They're the ones who have these utility functions in their minds even though if they're not. So you got to have to make those explicit. So here's an example. Uh you may have three different customers for your system. Here's your attribute some performance attribute. Customer one uh customer one is shown here. Uh they need a minimum amount of performance. But once you reach this threshold after that there's no more utility. But then customer two and customer three are different. They want you know their their their utility increases gradually. And in fact customer three doesn't see any much utility until you hit this much higher level. So one of the challenges then in designing these utility functions when you have multiple customers is to solicit this and there's interview and and survey techniques for doing that. uh and then combining those and then the other uh challenge in combining them is that remember at the system level utility is still between zero and one right so if you had for example two attributes and they both give you perfect utility and you add them together you'd get a utility of what you have two attributes two but that that can't be because the total system utility can never be better than one. So you have to normalize as you combine the utilities, you have to normalize them and actually uh weigh them as well. So here's here's the equation. When you have two utilities, uh you basically have the utility of the system just from J1, your first attribute, times the utility of J2. This is the mixed term, right? the the combined term plus the utility of just U J1 plus the utility of just J2 and then you have this K factor here this capital K factor which renormalizes everything to zero and one and if you have more than two then it's becomes kind of a matrix calculation so it's a little tricky for how to do this properly but it it's well known how to do this so the steps in multi-attribute utility analysis are to identify your objective ives and attributes. You develop an interview questionnaire. You administer that questionnaire. You then develop your aggregate utility functions. You determine the utility of your alternatives. And then you analyze the results. And there is one word of caution I want to give you which is that utility is essentially the surrogate of value. But value often we express in in in dollars and monetary terms. But utility is unitless. So um let me uh just comment about utility maximization. Uh it's very common and generally well accepted. Um it it's a nonlinear combination of your criteria your your decision criteria. The downside of it is the physical meaning is is often lost because the the sort of engineering or customer focused attributes all get combined. So you say this system has a utility of 0.83 and this one has a utility of 75. So one is better than the other. But immediately you want to say well why is that? You know what does that mean? So then you have to backtrack and reverse engineer of how those utilities were calculated. Uh you need to obtain a mathematical representation for all your utility functions. And this is a probably not just US- ccentric comment. This is probably everywhere in the world more or less but uh the utility function can vary drastically depending on the decision maker. This is a big issue in government programs. So you guys uh it's uniform day I guess today. So uh how long is a typical tour of duty of a program manager in the Pentagon for you know a big program? What would you say? It's usually three to four years. So three to four years like it's written here. And what what does that what does that mean in practice for these utility functions and for programs? Sorry, I'm putting you on the spot here. Well, you don't usually have a lot of overlap between the PMs. So, as one goes out, another one's coming in. So, you're you're losing a lot of experience. gaining somebody who doesn't have much experience. So there's a learning curve here, right? That's right. What I'm getting at is so that there's definitely that effect, but the priorities may be different. you know, whereas the the prior program manager really valued a lot um you know, performance or quick response and the next program manager because maybe the context has changed is is very very costconscious. It really wants a system that's very very affordable and is willing to sacrifice performance for that. So what the way you can think of this is the shape of the utility curves for those decision makers has now shifted and because of that the architecture or the choice of concept that you would go for may be different. This happens to NASA all the time. Right. Right. And so this is not just a DoD issue. This is and in commercial world you know a new CEO comes in, new CTO comes in uh and these utility curves actually shift. So you got to be you have to be aware of this. So one of the big topics there is particularly now with NASA is um how do we how do you choose an architecture a concept that is robust to changing utilities and decision makers. So maybe you don't go for the super duper best, most exciting, most capable concept, but you go for the one that's least likely to be overturned or disrupted with the next administration. And and this is a a discussion, active discussion right now at NASA headquarters. You know, what are the investments you can make that are going to provide utility even if the utility function of the future decision makers changes? It's a big big topic. Um the other thing is of course this requires your formulation of preferences. Those K factors those K those waitings a priori before you've actually scored the the alternatives. All right. So the the example I want to talk you through is um is essentially a space tug. So we're going to do trade space exploration. There's a trade space, a design space of alternatives, conceptual alternatives. And we're going to we're going to try to understand that using utility theory. And uh let me explain to you what we mean by space tug. So a space tug is essentially a satellite that has the ability to change its orbital elements. Right? There are six orbital elements. Uh semi- major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right? ascension of the ascending node uh and so forth of of a target satellite by a predefined amount without degrading its functionality in the process. So here's a a picture of the earth uh there's two orbits. The space tug is here in a in the black orbit and then our target satellite is in the orange orbit. And so the the typical process is uh the space tug waits in its parking orbit the black orbit. It gets tasked. It transfers to the other orbit, searches for the target, identifies it, rendevu an approach, docking and capture, does an orbital transfer, then releases the target satellite at the new orbit, verifies its status, and then either goes directly to the next target or returns to the parking orbit. And as you can imagine, depending on the plane changes that are required here, this can be quite expensive. uh it's less expensive in geocynchronous orbit and there there are some capabilities uh that we think heard about in the public that US and maybe other countries have as well to do this um and but there's also applications commercial applications for it so for example for space debris removal and things like that so that's what we mean by space tug so what are the attributes what are the Uh so this is based on a paper uh from uh 2003 called understanding the orbital transfer vehicle trade space and uh so here's here's three attributes that are combined into utility. Total delta V capability. Delta V is the change in velocity. This essentially tells you where can it go. Uh you calculate that from from essentially the rocket equation. The second one is response time. How fast can it get there after it has been tasked? And there there's a big distinction between it's almost binary between electric propulsion which is very efficient but slow and uh and then chemical propulsion. The third is the mass of the observation or grappling equipment. And so this tells you what it can do when it gets there. So the size of target satellites that can be actually interacted with. Those are the three um attributes that define utility and you combi we combine those into a utility between zero and one. And then this in this case cost or a surrogate for cost is kept separately. This is the vehicle wet and dry mass. These are the cost drivers and this is calculated from some simple scaling relationships. And so what we're interested in is looking at the trade space of utility versus cost of the system. So how is utility defined for a space tug? Um so we have uh response time um which is you know bad in electric systems. A total utility is a weighted sum and then we estimate the cost from wet and dry mass. So the delta v utility is shown here. This is in terms of meters/s. So 2 4 6 8 10 kilometers/s. These are pretty large delta v's. And what's interesting is this this uh this is a larger is better but it's a step curve. It's not a smooth curve. It's a step curve. Why is that? because um as you reach certain delta vs it enables you know operating just in geo or a leo geo transfer or a leo geo return right so you can you can use the space talk more than once the more delta v you have and it's a step curve because as you hit this value of delta v you can now operate in a different regime uh the capability the payload mass utility is is essentially discrete discretized between low, medium, high and extreme. H so low is for small satellites, medium is satellites up to one metric ton, up to three metric tonses and then more than five metric tons which are the big you know satellites in geocynchronous orbit. And then the waiting factors are we're going to weigh capability 30%, delta v 60% and the time responsiveness of the system 10%. So time responsiveness is not that important compared to the other two. So once we have this I'm I'm not going to go through all the details of the the calculations that um that's in that paper which I'll post. Uh you get this. So this is a cloud of points. Each point here represents a particular alternative or architecture and we have the cost of the system in millions of dollars. So this is not cheap, right? This is a billion dollars, two billion, three billion. And then we have this utility, this dimensionless utility. And of course, what we're particularly interested in is this lower right corner, high utility, lowerc cost systems. And um what we did here is to identify some uh particularly interesting architectures. They're shown here in the space. So let me just explain two of them. uh one of them here we and we gave them names that are recognizable. So this point here it's below 04 in ut so it's a rather low utility lower utility system but it's also relatively affordable is we call it the byprop lower earth orbit tender. So it's intended for use in lower earth orbit and it has a dry mass of about 680 kg a wet mass of 1400. So the difference is propellant, right? About 800 kg of propellant and has reasonable size and mass fraction and it's fairly responsive. Another uh alternative is what we call the electric geoc cruiser. Sounds cool, doesn't it? This is basically a space tug that operates only in geocynchronous orbit. So you launch it to geocynchronous orbit, but once it's there, it can do a lot. Um, but it's electric, so it's kind of slow. 711 kg dry mass, 1100 kg wet mass. Um, and it in uh it includes return of the tug to a safe orbit. And this is sort of a versatile space tug in the geo belt. So that that's the that's the idea is that you that you calculate the utility shown on the x-axis. You have the cost of the system. you have this cloud of points and you start understanding what are the interesting architectures in that trade space. Um this is the same trade space but now what we've done here is we've shown the choice of propulsion system is critical and what you can see here it's really almost impossible to get to a utility of one. It's very very hard and uh the reason for this is the rocket equation. You you know you see how these so the the blue are the bipellent architectures the uh purple are the cryogenic so these are locks hydrogen uh propulsion the yellow ones are the electric propulsion system and then we also have nuclear propulsion here which clearly is is challenging and has policy implications so you can see the nuclear propulsion gets you close to much higher utility but it's also much much more expensive but in all cases as you're trying to get more and more utility At some point you hit the wall because of the rocket equation which is very nonlinear. You know more fuel in order to carry more fuel. You need more dry mass. More fuel and dry mass requires more fuel to push and and this the system blows up on you. And you can see this in these curves. So you you get some physical intuition in terms of the shape of the space. Yeah. Is there a reason between this sort of layering of cost? Yeah. They're they're essentially um essentially if I remember correctly the um the capability of the system do you remember there's the small medium large you know the the size of the grappling equipment uh I think that's the taring that you see um well it depends on the waiting right so as you change the waiting among the attributes that space can get scrambled this is this this space is valid for that particular waiting So any any questions about uh this is utility theory multi-attribute utility theory applied to trade space exploration any any question go ahead do you have a question [Music] okay so now what you see here is kind implicitly is it there's nothing here in the lower right corner. There's no system that has, you know, perfect utility and is is low cost, right? There's there's an empty space. We'd love to be here, but there's nothing there. So, the best we can do is get close to that. And that's what I want to talk about next, which is this concept of non-dominance. So, what do we mean by non-dominance? What is a Pareto frontier? And uh what is multi-objective optimization? The key point about this is that when you do when you do non-dominance filtering, when you look for Pareto frontiers, you do not need to express your preferences ahead of time, right? So when you do util when you do a weighted pew matrix or when you do utility theory, you had to define ahead of time before you did the scoring what's more important. you know, fuel efficiency is twice as important to me as cost, right? The waiting, the preferences had to be expressed a priori before you did the scoring. And and you know, there's there's arguments that that's not the best thing to do, but you can do it here. Uh in non-dominance, uh multi-objective optimization, eventually you have to express your preferences, but you do it after you've scored the options. That's a really important distinction. So, let me give you a little history here on this. And what's really interesting is there's a Loausan connection. Okay? There's a connection with Loausan. So, the word Pareto Frontier uh is named after a uh a scientist who actually started as an engineer, Vfredo Paredo. He uh was born in Paris in 1848 um and then graduated from the University of Turin in 1870 uh very much in engineering civil engineering. His thesis title was the fundamental principles of equilibrium in solid bodies something we take you know that's pretty basic now forces and torques in equilibrium on a on a on a body. Now um he worked you know as a civil engineer in Florence and then he got interested in philosophy, politics and economics and he started to think about this in terms of uh what how does this concept of equilibrium apply to economics and then in 1893 he actually became a professor at the University of Lausan which is located right next to uh EPFL and started applying this to um to uh to economics and sort of societal theory and um there there he did some some of his work was a bit controversial but the the the one that I want to talk about here is this the idea of the PTO optimum and I will let me just read this quote to you. The optimum allocation of the resources of a society is not attained so long as it is possible to make at least one individual better off in his or her own estimation while keeping others as well off as before in their own estimation. So what it means is if you can if you can make an investment or make a change in society that makes a particular individual or group of individuals better off in their own estimation without having to take the resources from another group and make them less well off then you've you've not reached an optimal allocation of resources. You know, if there can be a win-win, if everybody can be better off by making certain investments, you haven't yet found the optimal strategy only when the only way to make somebody better off in their own estimation than somebody else is by taking and this is, you know, a big political debate still today, by taking from one group and redistributing resources to the other. When you're in that situation, then then you're at the Pareto optimal uh point. Okay? So that's uh that's the key idea uh underlying this. So what this means is mathematically uh is that um an optimal solution xar is optimal if and only if um for a feasible solution. So first of all the solution has to be feasible and this is when you have multiple criteria. uh we're trying to do vector optimization and x must be what we call an efficient solution and it's efficient only if its objective vector j of x is non-dominated and what this means is that if you're looking at a point it's it's only efficient when it is not possible to move from that point to another point without degrading uh at least one of the other objectives. Okay. So if you can move from a particular design point to another design point and all the objectives get better, you're not yet efficient. You're not yet at a Pareto optimal point. Um and this gets us to the notion of dominance. Okay. So dominance, let's say we have two designs, two alternatives, uh J1 and J2. Those are their objective vectors. It means that uh this is for maximization. we're trying to maximize it means J1 dominates J2 weekly if J1 is better or equal to J2 and uh at least in one of the objectives I strictly better than J2. Okay, so you could have two alternatives. This gets back to Q matrix and the question who asked about the ties you did right so long ago it's like wait a minute it's like an hour ago you know so we have two alternatives okay they're all equal they're they're tied in all criteria except for one where J1 is better than J2 which means that J1 will dominate J2 but weakly because there's some ties right and Then there's a stronger definition which is that J2 strongly dominates J2. J1 strongly dominates J2 if and only if it is better strictly better in all attributes. So for one to dominate J2 strongly, it's got to be better in all attributes than J2. Does that make sense? Okay. So I know this is a bit abstract. So let's do a concept question that's sort of based on a on a hypothetical but but real example. So assume let's say you're you're in charge of designing a new commercial aircraft and there's four criteria. You want to maximize range. You want to minimize the cost uh dollars per kil kilometer flown. You want to maximize the capacity of the airplane number of passengers. and you want to maximize cruise speed in kilometers/ hour. So it's a multiobjective aircraft design. You do all the work, you do concept generation, you come up with eight concepts for airplanes and you evaluate them and they're shown here 1 2 3 etc through eight. So let's just look at number one. What does this mean? Airplane number one, concept number one has a range of 7,587 km. It has a operating cost of $321 per kilometer. It can carry 112 passengers and it has a cruise speed or max speed of 950 kilometers per hour. So I'm going to leave this up. This is a like a five minute. This is sort of a con on the next slide. I'm going to ask you and we'll we'll come back to this. Which of these airplane designs these eights are non-dominated? meaning that they're not dominated by any of the other. And we're going to apply weak dominance here. That was going to be your question, right? Weak dominance. So, I don't think it actually matters. I don't think there's too many ties in here, but uh apply weak dominance. So, which of these are non-dominated? Meaning that you you wouldn't discard them right off the bat, right? Because there's some strong features that they have. So work through this. Uh you might want to write down uh which ones are uh non-dominated and then we'll we'll do the concept question and then we'll show you the answer. I just want to make sure. So non-dominated as in there is not one that could be considered better than it or Yeah. So um just this is the definition. All right. So, let me So, please submit your answers. So, here's the choices. Uh, which airplane designs are non-dominated? 5 six and seven? 1 1 3 4 and 8 1 2 3 4 and 8 2 3 5 and six 1 3 4 and 7 or you need this is not this is not answerable. You need more information to answer the question. Okay. So we have uh a pretty pretty good distribution here. So the wisdom of crowds I think prevails. So the correct answer is the third one. 1 2 3 4 and 8. So 36% of you got it right. Now let me let me show you the the solution to this. So it is in fact possible to answer this without additional information. So the way to do this is you have to do pair-wise comparisons. Now you you said about uh I think your strategy you said what did you say early on if you just push you were looking at maximums. So you were saying who's the best performer among the concepts for each criteria and and you found those pretty easily I would assume right? Yeah. So what um okay so you got to get the sign right. Do you have the mic on by the way? Um so what would if if a concept is the best performer in a criterion? What does that tell you? Um it means that none of the other performers have something equal to or greater than that uh performer for that set criterion. So, and this this relates to the question. Is it is it m Martin? Martin in the red shirt first row. I didn't get your name right. I'm sorry. Bastian. Bastian. Bastian. Bastian. You remember at the start of the lecture you said, what did you say at the start of the lecture? Um I said that if you evaluate all the concepts um based on just plus or minus for the criteria, you might have one where you um evaluate um all the uh a bunch of criteria that are negatives but there's just one that is positive but that one might be very very positive. Right? So that's exactly the point here. That's exactly this point. If you are if this concept is the best performer in just one of the criteria like it has the best speed or the lowest cost but it's terrible terrible in everything else. It doesn't matter in terms of dominance it cannot it is non-dominated. It cannot be dominated by any other concept. If you are the best in class even just for one criteria. Does that make sense? You cannot be dominated by any other design if you're the best performer at in on just one criterion. So let's think about track and field, right? So the uh people who's doing track and field any athletes here like runners or or javelin or Veronica, I didn't know that about you. I used to run cross country and track. Okay, so 5K. Uh yeah, the 5K. All right. So, but so you let's say you I'm sure you were very good at 5K, right? And how's your shot put? I never competed in the shot put. Okay. So then we don't know, right? But uh the point I'm trying to make is you could be a super duper specialist in one criterion and and that's you know, you can win a gold medal with that, but you're very maybe not good in in other things. So that's the point here is in order to be dominated if you're the best performer in so right off the bat in this exercise here in our little exercise you can remove all the concepts that are best in class from the set because they cannot be dominated. So they have to be non-dominated. Okay. So the way you do the scoring with pair-wise comparisons is you say let's compare one and two concept one and two. Well, one is better in um in range, right? Uh and it's better in in speed, but then the second concept is better in two and three. So, the score here is two versus two, which means neither one nor two dominate each other, right? Even if it's what if it's 3:1? What if it was a 3:1 score? It would still be true, right? that one doesn't one it's it's in a sense better because it's better than the other but it doesn't dominate it. See because dominance is a very crisp uh definition. Now this is different right? Compare one versus number six. Concept one versus concept six. One is better in all four criteria to six. So clearly solution one dominates solution six. And as a rational decision maker, you can eliminate concept six from the from the set because it is completely dominated by concept one. Okay. So in order to be dominated, a solution must have essentially a score of zero in a pair-wise comparison. Now if we apply this to the full set of eight, we can actually show this as a matrix. I call that the domination matrix. It shows which solution dominate which other solution. the horizontal rows and the vertical rows. So the way you read this is so where you see these dots these are dominance relationships in the pair-wise comparison. So this tells you that solution two dominates solution five. Um this tells us if we look column-wise solution seven is dominated by solutions two and solution eight. So if we do the row sum, if we sum this along the rows, the row indicates how many solutions this particular solution dominates. And but the question was about non-dominance. So we need to look at the column sum. The column sum indicates by how many other solutions the kith solution or concept is dominated. And when you do this column sum, you can see that uh concepts 1 2 3 and four have a zero. They're not dominated by any other design. Column 8 has a zero. And concepts five, six, and seven are dominated each by at least one other concept, which means that they're they're u they're dominated, right? And the others are non-dominated. So when you do your concept selection, you apply you can actually apply this to a much bigger set. You filter out all the dominated solutions. And it turns out the bigger your number of alternatives or architectures, the smaller percentage-wise the set will be of non-dominated solutions. And those are the ones you really want to focus on. Is that is that clear? I this I know this is uh this takes a little thinking about what does this really mean? But but that's a very rigorous way to do it. Um and then this this gets us to eventually this gets us to the notion of Pareto optimality. So what's the relationship between Pareto optimality and non-dominance? So let's say we have two objectives. J1, we want to maximize J1. Maybe that's you know uh performance endurance. We want to minimize J2. Maybe cost for example. So the the the utopian point or the optimal corner to be in is the lower right. Right? We want maximize J1, minimize J2. There's nothing here. It's empty. There's nothing feasible here. So the best we can do is get close to it. So when you look at a set of discrete points, discrete concepts, those concepts can have three properties. They can be D meaning dominated. So all the all the red points shown here uh are dominated. And and the way you can see this if you if you draw a little let me try to let me try to draw a box here. Um where's the eraser? So let's let's pick a point a particular point. Uh let's pick this point right here. Why do we know that this point is dominated just looking at it graphically? How do you know that? Go ahead. The point is not at the front. It's not at the front. But the way the way to find uh first of all whether it's dominated which is relative to the other solutions is we can just draw a horizontal line here right and a vertical line here and so in a multi-dimensional space you're essentially drawing like a hyper cube and here's down here is our utopia right this is where we would love to be but we can't be it's not feasible and you see in this box between the point and the utopia there is this other guy here this point here. And because it's there, it's closer to the utopia and it dominates this point, right? In both objectives. Let's take this point here. Let's do the same thing. Draw a vertical line and a horizontal line. And there's a whole bunch of points. All these points right here are all in the box closer to the the utopian point. So this point here is actually dominated by 1 2 3 4 5 six seven other points, right? So that's that's essentially dominated. Let me erase this again. Then we have we have these darker red uh purple points. Let me just circle them real quick. So we have this this point here, this point, this point, this point, this one, and this one. And those are what we call non-dominated like we just did the filtering, meaning there's no other point in the set that's better than it in all criteria. So you would you would consider them as concepts to choose from, but they're not exactly on that dashed line, which which means that there's a way to improve them. There's a way to tweak them to optimize them further if you could to get them right onto that dashed line. They're close, but they're not exactly on that dash line, right? So you could tweak these concepts to get them closer to the PTO front, but they're still they're pretty good because they're non-dominated. And then we have those gray points which are shown here. There's three of them. Let me use a different color for these. Let me use a different color. Maybe green. Oh sorry here this point this point and this point they are Pareto optimal mean meaning they're on the PTO front there's no way to improve them such that you could make both objectives better right if you want to make J1 better you have to sacrifice on J2 so the the only way to modify these points is to slide along the PTO front which meaning meaning you're trading off the objectives. Do you see that? And so in my in my spring class that I teach called multiddisciplinary system optimization, we get into this pretty deeply like how do you actually do this? But the point the point I want to want you to keep for now is that when you select a concept, do not select a dominated one. Get rid of the dominated ones. filter them out and then you still have to choose among the others and that's where your preferences come in. Right? So given the the blue and green choices here, which one are you going to recommend at the end? And that dis that's a sort of a a preferences between maximizing J1 and minimizing J2. That's a that's a social process of coming up with your preferences. But you now determine those preferences after you've scored all the concepts. Do you do you see the difference? That's pretty fundamental. Okay. So, one more thing and then we'll we'll wrap it up. So, now you've gone through all this work. You've done your concept generation, concept selection, scoring, and you you found the one concept that um that you're going to go forward with. That's when you do PDR. So, what is the PDR? The preliminary design review. You explain what concept and system architecture was chosen. You uh explain why it was chosen and uh and that's you want this to be approved as the design baseline for going forward and doing more detailed design work. You compare it against the rejected alternatives. Typically at the PDR you will spend some time on saying these are the other interesting concepts that almost were selected but we didn't because of these reasons. uh you show some quantitative analysis that gives confidence uh especially you want to show that the requirements that you had defined and agreed upon at the SRR can be satisfied by your chosen concept uh there may be still some risk or some uncertainty so any risk reduction experiments or prototypes so you can actually do prototyping at this stage you you don't want to spend too much on that but you want to do enough of it so you can reduce risks And then you do a preview of the detailed design phase between PDR leading up to CDR. So here I'm not going to read this, but this is the this is the description of what the PDR is all about. Uh in the NASA system engineering handbook uh on page 177 there's a very detailed description of you know entrance criteria, exit criteria, etc., etc. So here's a a description from a PDR from a European program and you can see it's a pretty big group right this is like 30 40 people and uh because the PDR is such an important decision uh that's when you also invite external stakeholders and you want to make sure that people come away from the PDR with confidence that yeah you know we have a good system architecture we picked a good concept and it's worthwhile now putting all this work into getting it to a detailed design that can actually be built. Okay. Any any questions about PDR or any experiences from PDRs that people want to share? Yeah, I have a question about the PDR. Um, how so you said there's 30 people in that picture. How does how do you reconcile that with the 7 plus -2 rule? Well, it's uh it's 7 plus or minus 2 squared, right? So, you have you have uh you have a hierarchy of people Not everybody is a decision maker here, right? So you have you probably have people who did some of the thermal design, some people did the cost modeling. So um it's a great question actually. Uh you want you want many many voices and people who contributed to make sure the PDR presents all the information you have. Uh you don't want to do a PDR with just seven people, right? But I guess you could say like in the presentation I guess only seven plus minus two will people will be driving at that point in time and doing so there'll be a leadership right and uh yeah so the there is an organizational issue behind this but but the point here is it is a it is a uh it is a it's a big review it's a big milestone. Yeah please go ahead. Uh the big issue here is that all the people that are not in decision makers that are on that picture they will have to implement the detailed design. So it's very important to have them in the process otherwise you have to go back to your organization and do the sort of PDR again to explain when the what'ss and the wise. So this is why we try to have these very large meetings. I mean, you do a PPDR and you do a dry run and you send the stuff in advance and you make sure that you really only agreeing finally if possible. You get the widths uh the the discrepancies off the table, but then you all agree that this is how to go forward and then the worker bees can go and do it. Yeah. So, that's another another reason for for being inclusive. I agree with that. Any other uh any who's gone through a PDR in their prior work. Do anybody want to share? Marissa, te tell us about how that went. I mean, as much I know there you can't probably share everything, but just for us. I mean, it was I mean, it's a pretty big milestone. You work you work a lot leading up to PDR and then you finally have all the really big stakeholders in the room and a lot of them have been involved during the design phases, but when you actually have them all sitting there um and kind of get I think getting the buy in was also a really I feel like that's a really big part of PDR. Like normally you're feeling pretty confident in your designs, but then actually making sure whoever the agencies that you're working with and your stakeholders are also kind of all on the same page. It's pretty critical. Do you discover problems or discrepancies during PDR? Yeah, I definitely think I mean you generally we've had delta PDRs um if things weren't completely thought through or you you'd have a fair number of action items that come out of PDR to go and address before you really are allowed to start moving towards CDR. Good. Good. Any any comments or experiences with PDRs at EPFL? [Music] I did a PDR at European Space Agency during the Rexus Bexus program uh three years ago and as far as I remember it was very appreciated to bring as many details as possible and to be really close to the critical design review stage in the PDR. That's interesting. Um, so that that's that's good. I think there's good to have detail and so forth, but what's the downside? Can you think of a negative? What would be what would be not so good about uh almost being a CDR right there? Can you think of a a downside to it? probably not taking too much time in order to clarify the concept and the requirements because you are in a rush to do to finish the product. That's a that's a good point. Uh so it's it's more it takes more time. But what I'm thinking about is it's very difficult to then undo the decision or backtrack. Let's say that at the PDR that there's some some you know it could be that you really forgot something very important and that that your concept is actually flawed but you didn't know it as you were working inside your team and then if you have a design that's almost CDR quality it's very difficult to undo that. So I I would say that a PDR I actually I actually believe that at a PDR you should have some detail but but not too much yet. I I think a true PDR should be at the system architecture level with some detail but not all the details. But thank you. That's a great uh that's a great uh um comment. Thank you very much. So uh let me close it here. So um in terms of concept selection during conceptual design we can use Q matrix selection um and uh and that's essentially useful when we don't yet have those detailed mathematical models. it's qualitative and then you know as we move more into preliminary design we use utility analysis um especially for non-commercial systems where you know a net present value a financial you know in commercial companies you will often do a financial analysis right as a measure of utility and then this concept of non-dominance is very very important uh generating many designs and then applying pareto filters to to to come down to the non-dominated set So that's essentially the essence of it. So I hope that was that was clear. Um A4 will be posted later today.
