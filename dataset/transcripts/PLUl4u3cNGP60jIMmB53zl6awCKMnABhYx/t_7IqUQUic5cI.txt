one of the one of the first assignments that I ask students to do in the class is to write a team charter now what is a team charter you can think of a team charter like a Manifesto It's essentially defining the identity and the goals that the team wants to pursue and you know in this kind of class there could be many different goals for example uh as a team you want to uh learn as much as you can about you know the process of systems engineering and design and so forth um another Charter could be that you are very ambitious and you want to win the competition so you want to score as high as you can and the ultimate goal is to be as highly ranked as possible in the competition another goal could be just to have fun you know to just have a good time to learn but essentially to really uh be together in this learning environment to to learn and have fun at the same time and U so the flavor of each team is a little bit different and rather than just letting it you know happen without much thought uh or or discussion the purpose of the team charter or project Charter is to to encourage these discussions early such that you know the team is is on the same page as they proceed into the project
