Teamwork is an essential part of the class because any great system or product is really the the result of of a teamwork. Uh where um in a team you have to balance essentially your own ideas and your your own desires with what your teammates think. And the dynamics of successful teams show that diversity is important. Being able to openly share ideas, also the ability to compromise and not always getting one's way. What we found over the over the years and I think this is also supported by uh research and scholarship in design is that the optimal team size is about five you know four to six maybe up to seven people uh is is the ideal uh size of teams for this kind of project. And why is that? If you if you create a smaller team, you have less diversity of ideas and you also have less man or brain power of course to get get work done since you know once you've decomposed the project into its elements each of these elements need to be needs to be done carefully. So you want to have a team that's large enough to do the work within the time constraints. On the other hand, if the team is too large, then um there's a lot of coordination, there's a lot of overhead. You know, just being able to meet whether it's physically or online becomes harder and the efficiency of the team goes down. And so we found that a team size of about five people is ideal for this kind of of project.
