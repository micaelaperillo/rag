assessing student work uh as a team um has different challenges of of course the first thing you do is assess the output of the team's work uh whether that's a requirement set whether it's a set of initial Concepts whether it's a presentation that's given at a preliminary design review uh whether it's a physical prototype that they present as as a team um so that always should be the first um thing that is assessed is what is the net output that that the team has produced um within that uh it is not always easy to discern what has been the individual contribution since the the whole purpose of a team is that you know the the sum that comes out is greater than the individual parts so in the best functioning teams there's a magic that happens there there's a Synergy that happens there's an output that's only produced by these synergistic interactions of all the team members in in a sense um trying to dissect you know what's the individual piece that everybody did is counter this idea of Team Synergy that being said we also need to um assess individually the contributions and the learnings of students and we do this through a couple of mechanisms for example a peer review uh so you can do a peer review process uh it's trickier in smaller teams than in larger teams but um if it's done properly peer review can be very effective in in not only helping one understand you know who who um who are the contributors and who are the Free Riders this is always a big issue in teams is that the free riter syndrome where uh some team members contribute significantly less than others and this is often The Source can be a source of conflict and so understanding this is important but also having other mechanisms in the class such as an individual final exam and then the other uh written exam which is administered online and the other thing we started doing is oral exams which seems oldfashioned but I have to tell you in 15 to 20 minutes of a one-on-one conversation with a student at the end of the class you really learn a lot you learn a lot about what they've learned uh where they may still have confusion or misconceptions and also the feedback that they give you so I highly recommend to do oral exams if it's possible
