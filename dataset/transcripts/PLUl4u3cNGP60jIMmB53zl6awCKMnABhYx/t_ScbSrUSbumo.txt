it's it's a cylindrical container containing a tape covered with adesive substance that can be deployed in order to attract and capture insects okay good I'm glad you added the last part because I was worried that the F you weren't going to talk about the function but so uh that's it's good I think it's good it's you you started describing the form and then you added you know you explained what the function is at the end so that's good anybody else do Mr Sticky here yeah do you want to share uh so we said it was a portable canister Deployable fly attracting sticky tape fly catching mechanism all right uh yeah I think you got the right elements I think the the this needs to flow a little better but but but you you got the right ingredients there what about the uh the I3 anybody uh yep go ahead Jus say that again can you turn on the mic please again um we said it was an efficiency and urban optimized transport vehicle made by BMW Urban transport vehicle I think I think it's good I think you're missing um I think you're missing the fact that it's an uh all electric you know the fact that it's based on that it's fundamentally an electric vehicle uh I think is key to the I3 because you you have other Urban you know like the Smart car and the so architecturally distinguishing feature is definitely the electric drive so I think it it's good but I think you're just missing a little little bit on the technology there what about I3 at epfl anybody do the I3 nobody nobody okay anybody else here uh yeah Veronica we have a transportation system thank you sorry a transportation system responsible for moving people and products within an enclosed metal frame equipped with various safety devices using electrically powered control and Locomotion subsystems okay that's that's that's that's pretty good there's a lot there I would I would do a question what the concept you you defined could almost apply to like a Tramway as well like if if we were you know if this was like a street car yeah don't you think it would apply to that as well so I think the fact that it's a p a personal vehicle you know I think is important um so so the the key in this is describe the concept using few words precisely but to set it apart from neighboring concept um okay what about Rolex [Music] Center yeah it's a single layer uh building with multiples floor used as a library for people to meet in STD okay a single story building using multiple uh floors it floors oh yeah so it's it's that's right that you have one layer however it has this wave shape and therefore you you have something to two two floors so the library is on something like the Upper Floor and the the meeting areas the noisy areas on the lower floors yeah so you can connect both but the noise doesn't connect that easily yeah no that's that's very good and I think that's sort of the architectural the uh and the the library is there that's for sure but I isn't there a lot of other things or Services provided in that building beyond the library yeah you have a bank cafeteria um student services but you could Encompass it probably in um in a meeting area you meet and you you do some stuff like eating going to the bank right so I I think by I think you miss some functions but yeah so I you know I I I like what your definition but I think by pointing out the Li you're missing the other functions and my understanding is that the reason this was built was to put two things one is it's it's a focal point for the community right at epfl we have a student center here at MIT people go there to do their banking you know their they're uh they're eating they're meeting and so forth so in that sense it's pretty similar but I think the Rolex Center is such an iconic building that it also served a kind of a Prestige function right to put to put the institution on the map in terms of uh you know it's a statement it's not just a utilitarian building whereas I would argue our MIT Student Center is it has very similar functions to the Rolex Center but I wouldn't call it an iconic building it doesn't have that wow factor would you guys agree with that yeah maybe it did you know when it was initially built I'm not sure but uh okay very good so you know we could spend a lot of time on these but really crisply refining and thinking about the concept is is very very important okay so let me very quickly go through the refrigerator case study to show uh what how do we sort of transition from concept to design so the first thing you do is understand where's the value right the the stakeholders and the the stakeholder analysis um and uh and the requirements definition and so in order to do that you ask the question uh first of all value identification where is the value right and so you understand the Ben who's the beneficiary that's a stakeholder the stakeholder has needs I'm I'm using OPM here to describe this and then this is a funny thing here the needs have these little little bumps this is meant to indicate a cloud the needs are sort of uh this is not standard OPM nomenclature just point that out so this means the the needs are somewhat U vaporous you know they're they're not very well defined and then you interpret and incorporate uh some of the needs into goals which become requirements right and so the the goals then are an instrument of the primary delivery uh value delivering process which is your value proposition to then actually deliver that value you need to design the product the product system the product object and uh understand the operand the thing that is being operated on or transformed by the primary value delivery process that's a very abstract high level way to think about where's the value uh in the system and but but fundamentally this is part of the reducing ambiguity uh work that you do as a system architect as a system engineer and there is a recipe for doing this so first you start examining the upper end associated with value what's really the thing that generates the value that the user the beneficiary cares about next you say this is the attribute link what attributes of the oper end are changing or being affected associated with value and so the attribute transforming process is where the value is generated um so for food we I think we briefly talked about this um uh before you know usually people would say when you think about a refrigerator keep the food cold but if you step back and think about it in a more abstract way it's really about preserving food or uh reducing the spoilage rate of the food so the the refrigerator effectively becomes a spoilage rate a food spoilage rate reduction device right and I I know that sounds terrible but that is really what it's about um so one once you think that way you can really start being creative and focus your creativity so here we have the food and our goal is to reduce its spoilage rate and then you can ask well how can we do this right what are all the different ways of reducing the spoilage rate of the food and uh so from among these system operating processes we then specialize and pick a particular one for our concept so uh beside chilling or keeping the food cold we could uh irradiate the food right we could uh we could dry the food uh what are some other ways that we can reduce the spoilage rate so irradiating drying chilling Sam preserving so with you add chemicals essentially epfl how else can we do it spoilage rate reduction using chemicals yeah so that's uh chemical that's that's uh yep that that's right what else keep going this is actually one of cuz food is pretty uh essential for humans this is actually one of the areas where humans have been very creative there's a lot of ways to do this so keep going yeah for example for conserving grapes maybe you do wine which is a process to to yeah yeah conserve this a wonderful thing yeah please keep some keep keep some wine for us too please okay yeah beer is the same yeah um so marinating it vacuum packing smoking on and on and on my favorite is actually um uh eating it what do bears do how do bears conserve food fat right so Bears uh they actually consume it and then transform it into fat right into a different storage form store it inside their bodies and then as they uh as they um hibernate uh that energy that food is being sort of gradually consumed right that's a that's a very different way but it's essentially the same function so that's the key idea is start thinking in this abstract way and all of a sudden you know all these other possibilities become possible and that's really the cool part about design and creativity but eventually you have to pick a particular concept so the chilling part is not enough that's the function and then you say well we need a chiller in order to chill we need a chiller and there are different types of chillers like a cooler or refrigerator and it's the combination of the specific way you're going to operate the system the element of form and then the specialized element of form in this case the cooler that combination is what we call Concept so once we have that we can start managing complexity decomposing function and form so our system operating process gets decomposed into the primary supporting processes like interfacing powering controlling and then our system object you can decompose it into different elements supporting systems the operand the operator and so forth and then then we can start connecting them so let's look at for chilling the food let's look at a cooler and a refrigerator in terms of this decomposition so here's a picture of a very you know simple cooler that you would take out on a picnic it has the chilling function and then the subf functions when we zoom in are holding the food exchanging the heat right between the food and the environment reducing the heat load interfacing connecting powering regulating the temperature Etc and then on the form side the cooler self is very simple structurally it just has a a a bottom right a box with a bottom and a top then we have the ice the food uh supporting the should say surface the external heat load ambient light and the operator what's surprising here is when you map the two there's a surprising amount of complexity right there not a very clear onetoone mapping let's just look at the ice so here's the ice and you can just follow these links to see what functions sub functions does the ice support exchanging heat powering and regulating temperature right so exchanging heat means essentially the ice itself acts as a heat exchanger just the surface of the ice is what a heat exchange happens so uh what forms can you put ice into a a a cooler what are the different shapes of ice that you could put into a cooler like an ice pack you could put ice pack so or you could put a block right or chips and what will be and if you put the same quantity of ice but you put a block of ice you put little chips what what will be the difference will will there be a difference surface area right so the the speed at which the ice will melt for the same given external temperature is going to be different right so so there's a there's a um um there's an attribute of the ice which is essentially its quantity but also its form that will influence the but that that's the heat exchanger function the powering function is pretty clear right that's essentially the uh the energy storage uh right there uh and then the third one is regulation how does that work how how does the ice provide the thermal regulation in the cooler physics 101 y yeah go ahead right so as long as you have any ice left in the cooler what will be the temperature inside if you don't you know not not open and closing but if you keep it closed what will be the temperature in the cooler 0 Celsius as long as you have ice left you know this is the the face transformation you're at that point as soon as the ice is all melted temperature will rise so the the the phase transformation of the ice from solid to liquid uh is what in fact is the regulation mechanism inside the cooler so even though you know you think of a cooler as being something super simple and trivial once you start listing its internal functions and and how these you know the the top the bottom the ice itself how they interact and support those functions it's pretty complex right and you can go very detailed here even for something very simple like a cooler um one question and then we'll talk about the refrigerator and how it's different in a minute one question I often get is what's the difference between system architecting and system design isn't it the same thing and um I think they're somewhat different they're overlapping but there's a distinction so architecture selects the concept the decomposition mapping of function to form and architecture essentially establishes the vector of design variables what are the key design variables and operating parameters of the system design then given that selects the actual values for those designed variables and then you can optimize so if we look at the the example of the cooler here we have our our cooler with the box in the bottom and then the ice and we can decompose the attributes of that so the box with bottom has length width height it has a wall thickness it has a type of material the top has thickness and material and the ice like we just talked about has quantity surface area and maybe initial water content and those are the operating parameters and and on the upper right those are the design variables so when you're making a material choice we're going to use uh PVC we're going to have a 2.1 inch thick wall we're going to use this much insulation this will be the aspect ratio of the cooler uh it's going to have wheels maybe so we can pull it easily those are essentially design decisions right you're you're instantiating that concept um but the fact that it it has a bottom and a top and it's hinged and uh it uses this phase transition you know as the regulation mechanism that's conceptual design that system architecture and you need to do both but they're not quite the same is that is that pretty clear that's that's a very important distinction so let's look at the form function mapping for refrigerator so this is actually uh this is a big difference between the US and Switzerland people in the US we like to have big refrigerators right we big gallon of milk and refrigerators in Switzerland are much smaller I'm not sure why maybe uh you know you go shopping more often but it's definitely one of the big differences but um here uh we have essentially the decomposition of the ref refrigerator so we have racks we have the air we have a I guess Freon is banned now so we we should use some other this is a refrigerant right a working fluid uh the insulation the feet and rollers the frame the electric motor sensors controller doors lights and then we have those functions essentially the same functions we had for the cooler holding the food exchanging the heat uh powering regulating but the difference is that we have much more of a onetoone mapping right so in the refrigerator each of these elements supports essentially one of the primary subfunctions so the form function mapping in the refrigerator is actually much simpler it's a much simpler form function mapping than the cooler and you say well I thought a refrigerator is much more complex how can that be well the real complexity comes in when you look at the form form mapping right so this is then the the decomposition of the refrigerator in terms of all the elements of form and then how they relate to each other and I'm not I'm not showing here all the subprocesses but you can see that uh you know the mapping and the relationships are much more complex than in the case of the cooler so to sort of wrap up on this piece um when we do uh conceptual design or system architecture you have two major activities one is concept generation so take the requirements and think creatively about how these requirements could be fulfilled so that means understanding the operand the attribute of the operand that you're trying to affect it could be multiple here uh the intent attribute this means sort of the required desired State what is the system operating process and what is your major element of form so that's generating this and and specializing that that's concept generation finding systems that do the right thing and then once you have several Concepts you got to select among them which we'll talk about next week that's our topic next week is concept selection so finding systems that do the right thing and do it well deliver value and comply with regulations standards and so forth so there's going to be consumables involved side effects you know like noise waste Heat pollution um the operator how skilled does the operator have to be or how autonomous is the system what is the reliability safety cost uh the quantity all those things are uh describing the concept and its instantiation in more detail and will help you do concept selection do do you see the difference concept generation is take the requirements and come up with uh the fundamental form function mapping of how the requirements can be met then you do uh instantiate that in terms of designs and then you can evaluate those and compare Concepts using uh other criteria like consumables quantity you know how skilled does the operator have to be Etc so those are those are fundamentally different activities so let me summarize on system architecture and then talk about um the NASA approach and then creativity so architecture requires consideration of both function and form Rel through concept it's about uh starting with the operand what is the thing that the beneficiary the stakeholder cares about and how do we transform that uh Concepts then elaborate these into architectures that have form function and structural complexity and then the goodness of an architecture is really a pretty complex concept where we have multiple objectives to satisfy including performance resource utilization cost operability safety capacity and and so forth and we'll we'll defer that to next week okay so let me briefly talk about the NASA approach to this and then talk about some methods and tools for concept generation so the NASA approach is is basically described in the system engineer handbook in the SC engine as step three called logical decomposition and uh so the The Logical decomposition process uh as described in the NASA standard is used to improve the understanding of the technical uh requirements and the relationship among those transforming that set of that initial set of requirements into uh a decomposition so the idea that we need to partition the system and then derive lower level technical requirements based on that uh and that lower level definition and that's what's called architecting getting back to our highlevel uh system design process this is again that diagram that we've looked that several times already you can see the red box is where this happens so we started with Mission Authority stakeholder expectation and then defining those high level requirements level zero level one requirements but then you get stuck right you get stuck because you have to make some decisions before you can go to lower level requirements definition and that's what's known here as functional and logical decomposition once you've decided on a decomposition and you can carry several decomposition with you for a while then you can do the lower level trade studies uh derive and allocate lower level requirements refine your conops and so forth and then do functional and performance analysis to see whether you have enough detail you know is it workable is it safe is it reliable and if yes then you can select that as a baseline if not you might have to go back to the red box which means that architecture didn't work we have to look for a different decomposition I or different architecture and if that doesn't work after multiple iterations here you might have to go back and change the requirements right because you come to the conclusion that the requirements are not really achievable so that's so some examples here of uh de composition models uh here's a timing diagram on the right side you have a state diagram the different states that the system can be in so this you can see this relates very strongly to the system modeling languages that we talked about so you use those system modeling languages to decompose and Define the system in in more more detail okay and that's um we've really talked about much of this already and in terms of The Logical decomposition uh flow diagram you start with your basic uh high level requirements and measures of performance you essentially do your decomposition and then on the right side you come out with the lower level derived technical requirements logic iCal decomposition models which would be essentially a description of your different subsystems uh and uh The Logical decomposition work products which are essentially lower level def definitions of what these subsystems look like and then you can go off and do the detailed design and then the testing verification and so forth so it's a it's a it's essentially focused on decomposition which is an important part of architecting but it's not the only thing you do so let me talk about uh methods and tools for concept generation so I'm going to start with this um this is another really fun thing we do in the uh in the system design and management program which is a ful year program is the we call it the creativity Workshop so what are what are different ways of of stimulating or organizing creativity and what I'm showing you here is a that's essentially a mind map of how to think about the creativity space so I'll I'll briefly go through this and then we'll we'll look at a couple examples so one idea is that creativity is is better if it's a group process that people stimulate each other and so this whole group up there is called group dynamics these are all different methods for uh stimulating creativity using groups of people um and some of these are authors that have written and methods so Deone six hats powwows mindboggling workouts creativity workouts these are all different variations of group dynamic processes the one that I'll talk about in some more detail is brainstorming this is probably the best known what's not so much known about brainstorming is that there's sort of a right way to do it right um on the upper right Branch creativity in system architecture this is just a sort of describing the importance of it the three themes we talked about creativity ambiguity complexity different types of innovation radical Innovation uh modular or incremental Innovation and so forth and the high leverage that it has the next Branch are called models of creativity what that essentially means and I'll give you one example here which is Leonardo Da Vinci is understanding people that universally are claimed as having been very creative thinkers uh what were why were they created what was their recipe for Success below that we have structured processes which are essentially um trying to organize the creativity which seems like an oxymoron but there are actually ways to have a structured process to stimulate concept generation and we'll talk about very briefly mind mapping and then morphological matrices and then we have uh this whole area here which uh I'm going to mention but we're not going to do uh as part of the class which is stimulants so this is the idea that uh somehow people are more creative when they uh when their their brain when you put yourself into some other state so um bioinspired design would be you go in nature right or you read books about sea shells and animals and you really try to understand from nature and there's a bioinspired design is a very important field of research now this is pretty serious so you you put yourself in nature and and be inspired by what you see uh random inputs provocations challenges and then things like alcohol uh and even drugs right so there's a lot you know the a lot of the music that was done in the hippie age in the 60s I mean a lot of these artists were consuming large amounts of drugs and alcohol and you know there's a big discussion on you know is this is this fundamentally why they were creative right so I'm not advocating that I'm just I'm just telling you that that there is there is this idea that uh you can stimulate creativity in these different ways so uh let's talk about uh mind mapping so this is an example of a mindmap that I really liked uh this is from several years ago um this is from a student that took the system architecture class and so the the idea of a mind map is that you you look inside yourself and you try to to put down on a on a map uh different ideas and Concepts so in the core of it you have you know the key focal point of the Mind map in this case it's system architecture and then you have these branches coming off so the class itself the skills the concepts the themes and then and then it sort of it almost looks like a neural network right you Branch off into the sub ideas and sub concept and in order to really make it memorable you you draw it by hand even though there is software for doing this but I really like this sort of doing drawing it by hand the old style and then you uh you add icons and symbols and colors to really make this sticky and memorable so you can look at that I really really like this example and you know it probably takes several a couple hours right to do a really good mind map like this but the idea is that by doing this you're going to develop your ideas and Concepts and there's there's books about mind mapping I mean it's it's a whole it's a whole industry almost brainstorming so who's by the way who's done brainstorming and organized brainstorming be who's been part of a brainstorming exercise yeah do you want to describe it how how that worked make sure you use the mic so we kind of started with our problem and it was if I remember right it was to redesign a coffee mug okay um this was for a class or yes okay and it was and then it basically the for the first part any idea could go and the Only Rule was like you couldn't criticize anyone else's um idea so we basically tried to come up with as much as we could wrote as much as we could on the board um things along those lines and then started to um once we had sort of all of our ideas down and some people built off of other ones and it was like oh but and we can also add this um and then we started to sort of look at well we can't really build that um this is going to be way too expensive and sort of started down selecting from there okay so did you take a break between the two parts of the okay so yeah that you described it very well so there's some the the key idea is there's some some rules for how to properly do brainstorming and some of them are listed here and then I have another on the next chart there're sort of a a step by step so it it's really uh try to remove creativity barriers stimulate each other there's sort of an ideal group size and it says 5 to 10 here but I should probably revise this to be what do you think 7 plus- 2 if you have if you try to do brainstorming session with 30 people in the room it's too big it's not uh it's not going to be that that productive so um use of intuition associations um what's important is that you have a clear idea why you're doing the brainstorming session so there's some solution neutral question like how can we improve a coffee mug did what did you come up with by the way at the end did you have a result or um I think it was we were going to uh redesign the handle so it would be more ergonomic okay U but yeah okay so you know what what can be done two how could we improve you know there's got to be sort of a a driving question for the brainstorming session the first uh you know this this actually the first time this was described was by AF Osborne in this book in 1957 and uh you know there's H H why is brainstorming useful uh we can talk about that a lot of it has to do with this group dynamics how to organize and host a brainstorming session I'll talk about that next and then there's this killer sentences you should never say during brainstorming some of these are pretty funny and then uh you know what do you do with the results like how do you actually then take the brainstorming results and use them for fur further refining or down selecting Concepts so here's here's a uh you know six-step process for doing a brainstorming session so you send out invitations um so it's a few days ahead of time and then the idea is that people can sort of you know think about this question uh so that when they come to the brainstorming session their their brain is pre-loaded with ideas that's the idea you don't just sort of pull people in like uh 5 minutes earlier and it's kind of like the the idea is give a few days not weeks but a few days of warning so that people can think about this and come to the brainstorming session you know ready and charged to uh share their ideas uh seven plus or minus two participants there should be a facilitator uh this is you know somebody who's was helping to moderate uh participants take turn expressing thoughts suggestions ideas uh you should take notes uh so for example these big whiteboards are great for that you know with the idea paint you know the whole wall that that's great or you can do flip charts you can do different ways of capturing these ideas and then I think you mentioned this it's called the principle of delayed judgment um so you're not allowed to criticize uh or particularly praise so you could you could for example say oh this is the best idea we've had so far in this session even though it's it's praise it actually implicitly is criticism of the other ideas so avoid that avoid the killer phrases and then the idea there is produce a large amount and diversity of ideas right and then at some point maybe 30 to 60 Minutes you end you know at brainstorming session that lasts 4 hours you know the first hour is probably really good and then the second hour okay okay and then the rest is you know everybody's kind of shot and there's not a lot of new ideas coming creativity killer sentences I highlighted a few this will never work uh we don't even need to talk about this everybody does it this way I've already studied this problem for years don't worry I know I'm right and Etc how long have you been with this company uh anyway so that's that's the that's the idea all right Leonardo uh who's been to Italy or tour in France or who's seen one of the exhibits you know where his notebooks are on display yeah what about epfl have you guys seen there's sort of these wondering exhibits about Leonardo's work and his notebooks anybody had a chance to see that go ahead yeah actually you do a lot of sketch and emphasize of the that the fact that sketching is more important than writing okay yeah that's that's right so uh really uh now he he didn't build a lot of his ideas right so that's one of the you know did he actually then but he was ahead of his time in many ways so he's really been identified as an exceptional individual so here's a book called How to think like Leonardo seven steps to genius and I'm not a big fan of these popular books but this this one is pretty interesting because uh what's been extracted from this is sort of the seven d vincian principles of creativity and I'm they're they're here in Italian I'm just going to go through them very quickly so curiosita lifelong quest for learning demonstra testing your knowledge through experience trying things out sens continual refinement of the senses spato which is essentially also a style of painting like the monaa is painted in Fato style uh mastering ambiguity Paradox uncertainty uh AR scansa is the whole brain thinking left right left right brain Corporal balance of body and mind uh so you know healthy mind and a healthy body and then conion is interesting that gets close to system architecture which is the appreciation of patterns relationships connections and systems right so the idea is that there's sort of from Leonardo sort of his work his way of thinking these seven principles have been extracted and then you can say well which of these you know do I feel really resonate with me all right so let's move to we have only a few minutes left let's move to some of the uh structured processes for creativity so the first one I want to mention is this is probably the simplest and the one that's used the most this is known as a morphological iCal Matrix so the idea there is that you you try to Define what are the key features factors or decisions that you have to make when you define a concept or an architecture so the key decisions are the rows uh let's say there's m key decisions there are factors in rows and then for each row you think about what are the number of possible alternatives for doing this um and then you enumerate all possible combinations so an example here would be here's our Matrix our morphological Matrix and then one possible concept here would be A2 B1 C3 right that's our concept here and then you can see that for a full factorial sort of enumeration you would have 27 architectures that you could generate so the number of architectures here is uh 27 based on this morphological Matrix and uh I find this to be very very helpful uh when the table gets too big you know very quickly because of this this being a product this can really explode on you it can be very large and uh the big challenge with this of course is if you have many factors you could generate many infeasible architectures not all these combinations are actually feasible so the question then is how do you prevent that and that's where U so-called architecture enumeration comes in and I'm not going to go in a lot of detail here but the idea is that through creativity expert knowledge and Analysis you're going to Define your components which are essentially the the rows in the morphological Matrix but you're also going to establish rules that tell you which combinations are actually valid combinations and which ones are not and that in fact is narx sort of PhD topic is how do you how do you increase the number of physics based rules rather than just um empirical rules because if you think about it if you if you apply rules that are just based on current practice then you're just going to recreate Concepts and architectures we already have you won't really come up with something fundamentally new because you've constrained the combinations to what people do now right so the real challenge here is between generating all possible combinations many of which are infeasible right and only the ones that we currently have there's a middle ground there so that's architecture enumeration and there's different ways of doing this uh at different layers of abstraction so here's an example of uh ta a airplanes you know different configurations of airplanes if you think about the tail of airplanes we have you know the the traditional uh tail with a lower hor uh stabilizer we have ta Tails we have you know we have uh vils I mean there's like uh 12 different tail geometries here and uh you could think of this for the wings for the fuse slage for the engine locations very quickly you can generate you know thousands or even millions of architectures but at that higher abstraction layer it's just a single tail right so how do you um how do you combine these using compositional rules that's architecture enumeration um so here's also an example from nar's work so at an engine a turbo prop uh engine at a high level of abstraction has basically a propeller an intake a core and a core nozzle and then to break that concept and further detail the core itself gets shown at a lower level of detail and you can see that inside the core you have in this case a single compressor a burner and then a turbine that drives the compressor and so one of the uh advances in engines has been from World War II to go from single stage to two stage three stage engines and so forth so the complexity has been going up but you can actually generate uh through architectural enumeration essentially all architectures that have have been built and that are known and have been certified through a kind of organized architecture enumeration process some of this can be done in Excel for example uh where you essentially list your components this is your library of components and then on a different sheet you define all the the different rules that allow you to combine different number of instances of these components into architectures and we'll we'll post uh we'll post some information on this if you want to try this out for uh for your uh Concepts so let me summarize um so system architecture is definitely very abstract uh it's the most uh but it's also the potentially the most influential activity that we in system architecting concept is mapping function to form we typically in the conceptual design don't do all the details we just go down two levels of abstraction so not all the details are defined the NASA approach um specify or is really focused on this idea of logical decomposition which is very important uh but it's it's not the only thing we do in system architecture and then the really cool part the exciting part in concept generation is the one that is a creative activity and and when you look at the the sort of set of creativity techniques you can think of group dynamics like the brainstorming that's that's uh that's used very heavily but you have to do it the right way if you organize a brainstorming session and you you you you know there's some wiggle room but if you violate some fundamental principles of brainstorming you're not going to get the full benefit uh models so you know thinking about really creative individuals um and and what drove them what were their principles and try to emulate some of that and then the structured processes which include mind maps morphological matrices and then
