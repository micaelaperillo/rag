All right, let's get started. Uh, welcome back to 61200. I am the second of the three lecturers in this class. Uh, you can call me Eric. Um, and Binmore will be on next week. Uh so today we are going to uh continue our theme of induction and prove some even cooler and stronger forms of induction. Just a recap of where we were last time. As we've seen, we're we're growing our catalog of different proof techniques of how to prove uh different types of theorems almost by like a cookbook. If you want to cook this, here's how you get started. And so here's a a brief summary of this. uh if the theorem you want to prove starts with there exists something then a natural way to prove that is by example or by construction you construct a particular x star and prove that p of xstar is true and if you can do that uh then you've proved that there exists an x where p of x is true it's kind of straightforward but it lets you unwrap if I give you an expression starts with exist then you know your first step is try to figure out an x where this is true um and of course to prove p of xar you probably recur cursively use this cookbook. If you want to prove a universal uh one common way if you want to prove for all x p of x is true uh typically your first line is take an arbitrary x just give it a name x and then prove that p of x is true no matter what x you started with therefore it's true for all of them. Uh come back to induction in a second. If you're if the main thing you want to prove is an implication, P implies Q. This is if P then Q. And I want to remind you that um P implies Q is the same thing as not P or Q. We'll use this a bunch uh today. Um then uh the direct way to prove this what we call a direct argument is assume P is true and then prove Q is true. Because this implication we only need to prove that Q is true when P is true. If P then Q. Uh or another way to prove that same statement P implies Q is what's called the contraositive. It turns out P implies Q is the same statement. It's equivalent to not Q implies not P. Remember this uh symbol is a negation um flip true and false. So to do that with a direct argument we would prove that uh if not Q is true then not P is true. In other words, assume not Q and then prove not P. This may seem kind of magical. Why is P implies Q the same as not Q implies not P? But it actually follows directly from this equivalence. If you look at not Q implies not P. Uh this is the same thing as let me go over here. Not not Q or not P, right? because it implies is the same thing as taking an or if you negate the first the part on the left and not not Q is the same as Q. Okay, so this was uh not Q implies not P is the same thing as this is the same thing as this and that is exactly this uh just by switching the order of the ors and so P implies Q is the same thing as not Q implies not P uh more uh so that was contraositive there's a related notion of contradiction where if you want to prove any statement P um you assume that not P is true and then find a contradiction prove that in fact false is true or something is both true and false. All these things are very very bad because we assume that our axioms are consistent. And so if you can prove false that means that what you assumed must also be false. Uh and if so if not P is false that's the same thing as saying P is true. Feels very backwards. Lots of double negatives in there but that's the nature of contradiction. We try to avoid them when we can but sometimes it's really the right way to prove something. And the last technique we saw was induction. uh where if we have a universal quantifier over the natural numbers, we want to prove P of N is true for all natural numbers 0 1 2 3 and so on. Uh then we only need to prove it for some base case P of 0 and then we need to prove that P of N implies P of N plus one for all N. So we'll talk more about induction in a little bit. Uh today we're going to add to this list two more proof techniques. One is proof by cases and the other is strong induction. So proof by cases is just a nice general technique to be aware of. Uh it's can be very powerful. Strong induction is going to be an even cooler form of induction. All right. But we'll start today with proof by cases. And we'll start with proof by two cases. and then we'll generalize to more than two cases. So, uh the idea is take any proposition C and observe that C or not C is a tautology meaning uh always true. Okay, if C is true, then this whole thing is true because C is true. If C is false, then not C is true. And so this whole thing is true. I'm going to remind you uh this uh so V symbol is an or. Uh whereas the opposite symbol is an and. I think the pneumonic here is this looks like a letter A. This looks like a letter O. I've heard some people say this looks like a lowercase R for or. Um anyway, you just remember these things. This is or this is and uh so C or not C is the question no is always true. Uh so we call it a tautology fancy word for being always true. And so uh what this tells us is that our proposition P let's say we want to prove P is equivalent to uh C or not C implies P. So this is saying if C or not C then P is true. C or not C is just always true. So this is saying if true in other words always P better be true. So P and this implication are equivalent. Another way to see that is to rewrite this implication as uh a negation I guess. So this is like saying not uh true or P and so that's just the same thing as P because this is true. Okay, cool. Uh so I want to rewrite this a little bit and say this thing is equivalent to C implies P and not C implies P. Uh why is this true? Uh it's like a distributive law. This is saying I want to prove that C implies P and I want to prove that not C implies P. That's what I wrote over there. Uh that implies that the combination of C and not C implies P. Okay. So I claim these are equivalent. You could one way to verify it is with the truth table or you can do it with some manipulation. All right. So uh we have uh what this is saying is in order to prove P we need to prove that P is true assuming C and prove that P is true assuming not C. And these are the two cases and proof by cases. Let me write out a little template for you. Let's suppose the theorem we want to prove is P. Theorem means something that's true and that we're about to prove. Uh and so we'd usually say proof by cases on the truth value of C. So this is uh for any uh statement seek proposition is what the word I was looking for. Any proposition C, it's either true or false. Uh and so we're going to do proof by cases on the truth value of C. Case one is that C is true and case two is that C is false. And so what do we do in each case? Uh well in the case that C is true this means that we get to assume that C is true uh and then use that to prove that P is true. And so the the missing step in this uh proof outline or this template uh is we need to say P is true because some reasons which we need to fill in. uh and similarly in the else in the C is false case we need to prove P is true uh for some reasons. Okay, so we need twice as many reasons but the idea is that maybe assuming C is true makes it easier to prove P is true. Maybe also proving assuming C is false makes it easier to to prove that P is true. So in these boxes here we get to use C and in here we get to use not C. And often this makes proofs easier. But the challenging part is to pick the correct C. What's the right choice of C for this to be true. Um, and maybe one more line I want to add to this template, which is pretty obvious in this setting, but gets much less obvious when you think about more than two cases. So a final step in this proof would be to say uh C is either true or false because all propositions are either true or false. And so uh the cases are exhaustive. So this is also called a proof by exhaustion. Not because we're really tired, maybe we are also. But the idea is we want to exhaust all possible cases. And if we prove that we we captured every possible situation and all of them P is true then we're done. Okay. So that's what we'd like to do. I'm going to give you two examples. First one is very simple. The second one is more interesting questions. All right. Um, so the claim is this is a general fact that a implies b or b implies c is a tautology. So this means it's always true again. So you can rewrite this as for all a, b and c uh which are either true or false uh we have that a implies b or b implies c is true. Okay, fun fun fact. Um let's prove it. And the proof technique we're going to use by cases by two cases namely uh on B B is either true or false. We could try to do a case analysis in terms of A or in terms of C. Turns out B is sort of the right answer here. It will lead to the fewest cases. We'll only need two uh intuitively because B is in both of these expressions. So it seems good to split on B because it will impact this one and this one. Okay. Uh so case one is that B is true. Okay. uh if B is true, I claim that A implies B is true, which is this first half. Why? Uh in other words, I I claim that A implies true is a tautology. I think another again an easy way to see this is to rewrite uh rewrite this implication as not the left hand side or the right hand side. Right? Not a or true. Well, that's just true. True or anything is true. Okay? So, in particular over here, uh not a or b is true because we just assume that b is true. Okay. So, this tells us that uh a implies b or anything in particular b or c is also true. Okay. So, kind of trivial, right? Right? If you assume B is true, then of course this is true and so of course the whole thing is true. So easy when you have the correct case. Uh let's think about the other case. It's not enough to just have one half of the cases. We also need to think about when B is false. When B is false, I claim that the other term is true. I claim that B implies C is true. Uh this is maybe a little less intuitive. This is saying that false implies C is a tautology like for any C false implies it. Um and this should eventually become intuitive for you when you get used to implies and if then this is saying if false which means never uh I need C to be true. But if I if this condition is never true then I don't care about the right hand side. If it's if you know if uh pigs fly then I don't know apples are orange or something. Um it that's a true statement because it will never be the case that pigs fly at least in the present time. So uh another way to see that is to think about again not B or C. B is false so not B is true and so of course true or C is also true. Okay. And so that tells us that anything or B implies C is also true. So in other words, this statement maybe I'll call P, I'll say in either case P is true. And so I write my little end of crew symbol. This is QED from last time. Uh this means that I have demonstrated the theorem. Cool. So in one case this part was trivial. In the other case this part was trivial because it's an or. We're happy in either case. And we've done our proof first proof by cases. Pretty straightforward. Let's do a more surprising result using proof by cases called mutual friends and strangers. This is actually a famous mathematical problem we're going to solve today a particular case of it which is suppose you have six people um and every two of them are either friends or uh and this is an exclusive or so. So I'm going to write exor. You're allowed to be friends or or not friends, not both and not neither. And in the not friends case, I'm also going to call them uh strangers. So this is like extreme friendship. Either you declare yourself as friends or as knowing each other or you don't know each other. In that case, you're strangers. You're just never both. It's always one or the other. Okay? So, you can think of this as I can draw a little picture of their six people represent by circles. You can put smiley faces in them if you want. And maybe I connect them via a white line if they are friends and a dotted line if they're strangers. So let's And every two of them have one of these two pictures. Probably missing some here. That's them all. Uh then I claim no matter how what the situation is, which ones are friends, which ones are strangers, there's always uh either three mutual friends for three mutual strangers. Okay, in this example, hopefully I drew enough. Yeah. Uh, these three people are mutual strangers. They're connected by a a triangle of dashed lines. Okay. If I drew some other pattern, like if they were all solid lines, then uh I might get the other situation, at least three mutual friends. But it turns out if you have six people, they're always at least three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. Let's prove this by cases. Whenever we apply a proof by cases, we need to come up with some proposition C that's either true or false. Well, for a proof by two cases, which this will be uh and it's a little work in this case to to do it. It turns out a useful first step is to pick any person P. So just take the first person or the seventh or the the fifth person ahead of six doesn't matter which one but label it P. So now we have a person to talk about. This is sort of like the proof by example or by construction right we want to overall there we want to prove an existence we want to prove existence of three mutual friends or existence of three mutual strangers. So it's a useful step to either construct one or in this case we're actually not doing much of a construction. We're just taking an arbitrary X, but that will be enough for this for this problem. Okay, so let me draw a little circle for P. Uh, and it might have some friends and it might have some strangers. Okay, how many of these lines coming out of P are there? Five. Exactly. Because there's six people total. P is one of them. So there are five people over here. Okay, so turns out useful case strategy is to uh say either P has at least three friends or it has less than three friends, right? Either there are three solid lines like I've drawn here or there at least three or they're at most two solid lines. Okay, let's think about this first case. P has at least three friends. Let's uh give them a name uh Q, R, and S. So uh that's sort of a general picture. Now we're assuming P has three solid lines to three people Q, R, and S. Okay, this is not yet a triangle. We haven't solved the problem yet, but uh if we break into more cases, we'll be able to. Okay. So, uh case 1 A is going to be uh sum two of Q, R and S are friends. Okay. Suppose uh for example Q and S are friends. Have I found a triangle? Yes. P Q and S are mutual friends. If this edge is here or if this edge is here then these three people are three mutual friends or if this edge is here these three people are mutual friends. If there's any edge in here that I can draw any uh solid line between QR and S then those two people plus P form three mutual friends. Okay. So that case is actually easy. Great. Then uh P plus those two people are three mutual friends. Okay, which uh was situation one up here. There's always either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. Okay, uh so now we need to think about the other cases. Let's go over here. We found one case that was easy, but uh there's case 1B, which is maybe there aren't two mutual friends, and there's case two where P does not have at least three friends. Okay, but it turns out all of these cases will be easy. So, let's do uh case 1 B. Now, I get to sort of freely choose what case one was, and I get to freely choose what case 1 A was because whenever I split into cases, I get to choose my proposition C to be anything I want. So this was C in the first case. This was C in the second case. But generally if you're doing proof by two cases, you have no choice at this point. So case 1 A was whatever. Case 1 B has to be the negation of this. Okay. So case 1B literally is uh not sum to uh of QRS are friends. Uh but if you think about that for a little bit, this is saying um Q R and S uh let me let me write this uh in a couple of steps. No two of Q R and S are friends. But that's the same thing as saying QR and S are mutual strangers. Okay, we're using this fact or this assumption that every two people are either friends or strangers. Always one or the other. So if there's no solid line over here, then all of these are dash lines. So all three of these are mutual strangers. And there we found our triangle of strangers. Okay. So it turns out case 1 A and case 1 B are actually just as easy, just sort of reversed. Uh so this was situation two. So either we got three mutual friends or we got three mutual strangers, but we're still inside case one. We just finished case one. Now we need to think about case two. So I'm going to unindent here and go to case two. Case two again has to be exactly the opposite of this. So P does not have at least three friends. Uh by number of people being an integer. This is saying P has at most two friends. Okay. If it doesn't have at least three, it's at most two because number of friends is always an integer. Okay, great. So that case two is a negation of case one. Um, and it turns out that is also kind of easy for a symmetric reason. Uh, remember there are six people total. So there's P and five others. So uh, how many strangers is P with or how many people is P a stranger to? Uh, well, it's at least uh, all the others. 5 minus 2 is at most two of them are friends. The remainder have to be strangers. And so this is three. So P having at most two friends is the same thing as P having at least three strangers because there are five other people total. 2 + 3 is 5. Uh so P case two is P has at least three strangers. Case one was P has at least three friends. These are almost the same. I just have to flip friends versus strangers. So the way I would write this in a proof is uh this is symmetric to case one uh swapping friends uh versus strangers. And of course uh case one or situation one with situation two. Okay. So case two would be P has at least three strangers QR and S. Case 1 A is that sum two of QR and S are strangers. Then we conclude that P plus those two are three mutual strangers which is situation two. Or case 2B would be no two of QRS are strangers. In other words, QRS are mutual friends. And then we're in situation one. So case two works just like case one just swapping the words friends and strangers because they didn't really have any meaning. They were just words. Cool. So in all cases uh we prove the desired result either situation one or situation two happens. Um this is a particular case of something called Ramsey theory. What we've just found is that something called r of 33 is uh at most six uh in general r of f comma s is the number of people you need uh in order to guarantee that there's at least f friends or at least s strangers. So we just did at least three friends or at least three strangers. We showed that six people was enough. It turns out uh six people is exactly the right number. You need six people in order to guarantee at least three friends or three strangers. If you wanted to guarantee four friends or four strangers, turns out you need 18 people. Uh if you want to guarantee five friends or five strangers, turns out you need uh somewhere between 43 and 48 people. But we don't know how many. So while this problem was relatively easy, three friends or three strangers, five friends and five strangers already is an unsolved mathematical problem. So that's kind of cool and crazy how easily you get to very difficult problems. Of course, people try to compute larger numbers too, but we don't have tight bounds generally. Okay, I want to say one more thing about proof by cases, which is what if we want more than two cases? Uh so more generally proof by K cases. So instead of just C or not C, let's suppose we have a bunch of propositions C1 through CK. And let's suppose that this is a tautology. favorite word for the day. So suppose that it's always the case C1 or C2 or dot dot dot or CK one of these things is always true. Then uh we can follow this template which is uh suppose we want to prove a theorem that some proposition P is true then we'll say proof uh by cases and there's K of them so I'm just going to write it generically in case I is that CI is true. In other words, we get to assume CI is true. And then what we need to do is prove that P is true in that scenario. And P is true because reasons. Uh and then here it's especially important to say that the cases are exhaustive. uh because reasons and exhaustive here just means that uh C1 or C2 or up to CK is a tautology. Okay, so you need to prove that C1 or or up dot dot dot or CK is is always true. That's the meaning of the cases being exhaustive. So there's sort of two parts. So one is to prove that each case is okay. The other is to prove that those cases cover everything. Okay. So um I won't show an example of K cases here. We'll see that I'm in restitation and so on. Uh but I will tell you a story about one uh famous proof by cases which is the fourcolor theorem. Uh I'll illustrate the four color theorem with an example. So here's a map of United States. uh and I've colored all the states, all the regions of this map with four different colors red, green, blue, yellow in such a way that if you have two regions that share a positive length boundary, then this color A is different from this color B. Okay, it has to be not equal. Otherwise, if you had two red regions next to each other, it' be hard to see the boundary. So the colors illustrate the boundaries between all the regions. Four colors seems to be enough for this map. Uh it's also enough for this map of all the countries. Is it true for all the maps? Turns out yes. This is called for a long time called the fourcolor conjecture and then it became the fourcolor theorem at some date. Uh so fourcolor theorem says you can color the regions of any planer map with four colors so the neighboring regions get different colors. This was first observed and sort of conjectured uh in 1852 by a guy named Guthrie who was a student of deorggan. De Morgan I think his name will come up in a moment famous logician. He actually invented induction as we one of the first people to he invented the term mathematical induction at the very least and really uh sort of made it more formal. Uh so a student of him Guthrie said hey I took all the counties of England and it turned out I only needed four colors is this a theorem and he asked uh indirectly de Morgan uh and Morgan said hey seems cool I don't know maybe then the following year 1853 uh another mathematician named Kemp uh proved the theorem but uh proved should be in quotes because uh 11 years later 1864 before Haywood found a bug in that proof. Turns out there were a lot of cases in this proof and the cases were not exhaustive. So it wasn't done. Then uh 15 years later, 1880, Tate proved the theorem. Then 11 years later, Peterson found a bug in that proof. Again, not all the cases were exhaustive. Then uh 85 years later, 1976 uh Apple and Haken or maybe it's a PEL, I'm not sure, uh proved the theorem and I think most people consider this an actual proof. Uh but it's a little tricky. Uh just to give you a sense, this this is where sort of my started I started hearing about the problem. I wasn't alive in 1976, but I heard about it later on. Um there are 1,834 cases in this proof. They occupy about a 400page printout from a computer program. And so th this is one of the first mathematical proofs that used a computer to assist in checking all the cases because there's so many 8 1,834. It's hard to do that by hand and be sure that you didn't make a mistake. So the computer proof to me is a little bit more sound. uh also apparently checked by hand uh by Haken's daughter. Um then five years later uh Schmidt found what you could interpret as a bug in this proof. Let's say an emission or something uh but a missing situation. Uh and then over the next eight years Apple and Haken fixed all the bugs they could find that one and some other sort of wording issues and so on and they proofed they published it in a book but book isn't refereed. So I don't know how many people have read that book. Um, seems like this proof is maybe correct. It's been many years and no one has found a bug. Uh, a little bit later though, 1996, Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas, some of the top graph theorists in the world, uh, found a simpler proof. That proof only has 633 cases. So that's a lot less, maybe three times fewer cases. And also the length of the paper is shorter, maybe 10 times shorter. Uh so that's progress but you know is that proof true it also used a computer to check the cases. Uh finally in 2005 uh Verer and Gonier uh developed a fully computer checkable proof using uh a system called coaul where you write down uh every step in the proof and then the computer just has to check that every u mathematical derivation like all the derivations we saw last class modus ponus and all those things are correct. this this program has been has withstood many many years of scrutiny. So we all believe that it's correct and so the fact that you can write the entire proof in this proof language suggests that this really is a true theorem. Now thankfully there won't be more missing cases. I believe that is just an implementation of the Robertson proof. So uh that one withtood scrutiny but it's very tedious to write these proofs and so uh for the fourcolor theorem it's uh worth it I would say all right so that's just an example of in general proofs by cases can involve a zillion cases it's very annoying but sometimes that's the best thing we know how to do maybe we'll come up with a simpler fourcolor theorem proof at some point but best we know so far has hundreds of cases all right let's go back to induction Uh first I want to review induction a little bit and then we will get a stronger form of it. So uh I'm going to call this the induction axiom. This is what we talked about last class. Uh we didn't call it an axiom and in some setups it is an axiom. We're going to take it as one. something that we just assume is true. Uh although as Zach mentioned in modern times you usually prove this using other using the definition of the natural numbers. Uh but I'll just take it as something is true. So for any predicate p of n over the natural numbers if on the one hand p of zero is true and on the other hand uh p of n implies p of n + one uh for all natural numbers n then uh p of n is true uh for all natural numbers Okay, this is the magic of induction. You should use this probably in every problem you solve. Not every problem, but uh extremely powerful tool. We're going to use it all the time throughout this class. I want to give you a visual way of thinking about what's going on with induction, which I call block diagrams. Uh so um I'm going to think of a block like a little box here that takes as input. Think of it as a procedure. You give it some true uh propositions on the left and it produces a true proposition on the right. Okay? Or you could think of it as if I give you some proofs of these propositions, then this block will give you uh a proof of a proposition on the right. Okay? So, uh what's going on with induction is we're given two of these blocks, these two. So, you can think of part one P of 0 is true as a block that has no input. So, this is what we normally call the base case. So it doesn't need to assume anything and it just produces for you a proof that P of 0 is true. Okay. And the second part here, the induction step says that if you can prove P of N is true and you plug it into the induction step, then it will give you a proof that P of N plus one is true. Saw a bunch of examples of this last time. We assume P of N and we use that to prove P of N plus one. Okay. Now the cool thing about blocks is you can just uh chain them together. So if we chain uh the only block we can place first is uh this base case because it doesn't need anything to get started. So we start with the base case argument that produces P of zero. Now we plug this into the step. This step has to work for all n. So in particular it works for n equals z. And so we plug that into the step and we get uh p of 1. We plug p of 1 into the step. So n equals 1. Then we get p of n plus one namely p of two. And we plug that into the step and we get p of three and so on. Okay. Okay, so this just gives you some intuition for if I can build an argument for why P of 0 is true and I can build an argument for why if P of N is true then P of N plus one is also true then I can just repeat that argument over and over with different n increasing N by one each time and I can use that to prove that all the P of N's are true. Okay, this is like visual intuition for why why this works. Um, of course, we're not going to actually prove P of N is true for all N, but uh should be pretty straight pretty intuitive from that. Uh or more abstractly you can actually think of induction itself as one of these blocks. Uh let me use another color. So we have on the one hand uh a block base which produces P of zero and we have uh an induction step which given P of N produces uh P of N plus one. So I'm going to think of this as a thing that's true and this as a thing that's true. And then what induction gives me? Induction is a block that given these two facts, if you can prove each of these things, then it gives me a new fact which is uh for all natural numbers n uh p of n is true. Okay, so that's sort of the instead of having to draw out this infinite length path, induction just does it all at once. It says, "Oh, I know I can chain these all together forever. Therefore, P of N is true for all N." Okay, I don't know if that helps, but it's another visual way of thinking about induction. Let's um All right. Let me tell you another uh equivalent formulation of induction which I prefer. starts out starts out the same. Suppose P of 0 is true. Uh the second the induction step I'm going to phrase slightly differently almost the same. For all n at least one uh p of n minus one implies p of n. Then uh for all natural numbers uh p of n. So uh the first and last lines are the same. We're assume P of 0 is true. We're going to conclude P of N is true for all natural numbers. Here we started at zero and we wanted to show that P of N implies P of N plus one. Over here we're starting at one and we're proving that P of N minus one implies P of N. These are exactly the same things. I've just shifted the indices by one. So these are identical statements or equivalent statements. Um I like this version in particular. it will lead into strong induction. But I like this version as a computer scientist because I always want to think about well I want to prove P of N not P of N plus one. It's confusing to think about proving P of N plus one. I always want to prove P of N when N equals zero. Okay, that's my base case. I prove that specially when N is at least one. I'm not in the base case and I get to assume that P of N minus one is true. You can think of this like a computer program. Think of a proving p of n is like running a computation f of n or p of n and I get to recursively call p of n minus one in order to compute p of n. n is given to me. This is the one I want to solve. If n is zero then I solve it one way. If n is bigger than zero or at least one then I recursively call p of n minus one or depend on that proof and use it to prove p of n. Okay. But you can use either one whichever is more comfortable to you. uh but really you should use neither and you should use this stronger form uh called strong induction. So let's let's do that. Strong induction just gives you more to work with. So it's in some sense more powerful logically it's identical to induction. You can actually prove it using induction and we'll do that. Uh let me first state the theorem. So if any natural number this is true then uh any natural number p of n is true. Okay. Uh let me bring this one down to compare. Uh so uh first thing maybe to notice is there doesn't seem to be a base case here. uh which is a little weird. It's just one condition then this let's compare the steps first of all um so or I guess let's let's think about the case this has to be true for all n if we think about when n equals 0 that's the missing base case what this is actually saying is p 0 up to p minus one implies p of zero okay so this is kind of weird notation I'm I'm abusing the dot dot dot a little bit here and uh for when n equals one this is p of 0 when n equals 2 this is p of 0 and p of 1 when n equals 3 I mean for a larger n it's very clear what this dot dot dot means but when n equals 0 it's confusing so I need to specify uh this is defined to be true uh for n equals 0 okay so for n equals 0 what you have to do is prove that true implies p of zero in other words p of zero must be true in all cases okay so there's Um, but then for larger n, what this is saying is not only do I get to assume p of n minus one, but I get to assume all the p of i's before p of n. So I would I would normally say uh p of i is true for all i less than n. This is what I get to assume. That's probably actually a better way to state this this thing. So with regular induction here, I got to assume that the previous P of N minus one was true and I needed to use that to pro prove that P of N is true. But actually if you look at this chain like by the time I'm proving P of three, I've already proved all the smaller PIs. So why not and assume that with strong induction I get to assume that in order to prove P of N I get to assume all the PI's where I is less than M. Okay. Now when N equals Z, I don't get to assume anything because there are no smaller I's. Uh but when I get to P of five, I get to assume P 0, P4, P 0, P1, P2, P3, P4. Uh so I get to assume more. So this only makes my proof easier. Okay. Um to be clear, uh this is usually proved in cases normally you need to uh check zero specially. That might be a base case. Maybe you have to check one specially. It depends on your implication argument. this uh often this implication assumes that n is at least something and then you have to prove all the smaller ns to be true specially but we'll we'll get to examples in a moment. What I'd like to do first is actually prove that strong induction is true. This is not something you would repeat in your homework. You should just assume strong induction is true. But I think it's instructive to see why it's true as yet another example of induction. Okay, so we're going to use regular induction this version or actually I think this version the induction axiom uh to prove strong induction. Okay. Now, this is a situation where we need to define a particular induction hypothesis. This not the obvious one and this is not at all obvious, but I'm going to define uh IH of N to be uh this P of 0 and P of N minus one. In other words, uh for all I less than N, P of I. I like that better because it works even when n is zero because there are no i's less than zero. So that's just true when I when n is zero. Okay, so this is the thing I want to prove for all n. And how do we do it? Well, uh as usual with an induction, we have a base case. Base case is ih of zero. So uh ih of zero is actually literally just true. uh because we defined it to be that way. We said when n equals 0 this dot dot dot is true or you could say uh this is saying for all i less than zero where i is a natural number but there are no natural numbers less than zero. So this is like saying if false then something and that's just always true. So this is by definition uh ih of z is true. Great easy base case as usual. Uh what's the induction step look like? I'm going to I get to choose. I could either assume I of N minus one and prove IH of N or I'm going to assume I of N and uh prove uh IH of N + one. So we want to show if N plus1 assuming IH of N. Uh cool. So the key thing is we get to assume this is true. The strong induction says if this then this. So we're assuming the if part we're assuming that if uh this implication and this thing here is exactly IH of N, right? So this says IH of N implies P of N. So we know IH ofN implies P of N. That's uh what we're get to assume in our theorem statement here. and we just assumed that IH of N is true. Therefore, P of N is true. Okay, but P of N was not what we wanted to prove. We wanted to prove IH of N plus1. So, what is IH of N plus1? Uh let's just expand out this definition here. It is P of zero or dot dot dot or P of N minus one or P of N because I've incremented N by one. This no longer ends at P of N minus one. It now ends at P of N. Okay, but this is almost what we had before. This is the induction hypothesis of N. That's this part or P of N, right? That's just formula manipulation. And this we assumed is true. IH of N is true. And P ofN we just proved is true. Sorry. Uh I wrote or here but I meant and everywhere. This is and and see even professors get the V's and wedges upside down. So I wrote it correctly here. It's the and of P 0 up to PN minus one. Here we have the end of P 0 up to PN. And so this is IH of N which we assumed was true by induction. and P ofn which we just proved using one induction step. Therefore, the and is also true. And I believe that's the end of the proof, right? I did a base case, I did a step. Oh, no. Quite not quite the answer. Sorry, there's one more step here uh which I will put over here. It's a good illustration and not skipping steps. Uh what did we actually prove by induction? We proved induction hypothesis of n is true for all n. So by induction like the regular old induction axiom uh for all natural numbers n uh induction hypothesis of n is true induction hypothesis of n is this thing but that's not what we wanted to prove. We wanted to prove p of n is true for all all n. uh but I can do some manipulation to make that what I want. So this is like saying for all n uh let's see actually probably this is nicer for all natural numbers uh ih of n plus one is true okay this is a shift it's actually a weaker shift this includes ih of zero this should not be greater than equal to this should be an element of uh this includes zero this doesn't this starts at one and it goes upwards But this is nice. Uh this so this implies this, right? Uh this is what we've shown. This is a weaker statement because I just threw away I of zero. I of zero wasn't interesting anyway. I of one uh includes inside of it. So it's an and of a bunch of things. But then the last term is P of N. Right? That's if I take Ih of N + one, the last term in is P of N. So it's also anded but uh if the and is true then every term is true and so therefore p of n is true for all n. Okay, so this was a final clean up after we did induction. We didn't quite get the statement we wanted because we used a more gen a different induction hypothesis than just p. Uh and then we needed to show that that implied p of n for all n. Okay, but it works. Cool. So now uh there should be no question about why strong induction is true assuming you believe this proof. Um you can draw a diagram. Uh it's a little trickier to do. Maybe I will show you uh in my handwritten notes here. Here is a block diagram for strong induction. uh it's harder to draw because you depend on so many things when I apply the fourth step here when I want to conclude P of four I assume all the previous PS so P 0 P1 P2 P3 they all feed into this box in the beginning it's very similar I apply a step I get P of 0 then I apply that P of 0 to a step I get P of one uh but then as I proceed I'm feeding more and more PI's into the step and it gives me one more pi. Okay, so it's a much more complicated diagram what's going on under the hood. But from a usage standpoint, it's it only helps you when you're trying to prove P of N. You don't just get to assume P of N minus one. You get to assume all the PI's uh where I is less than N. I forgot one part of the fourcolor theorem story which was when I was growing up I read a reprint of this article by Martin Gardner which turned out to be published on April fools but I didn't know it at the time uh and in at that in 1975 there was no proof of the fourcolor theorem Haken was I think one year later uh so at this point he published a joke saying in fact McGregor found this map which requires five colors I remember sitting trying to color it with with four colors and always failing. It's like, oh my gosh, fourcolor theorem isn't true. This is or fourcolor conjecture as it was called then isn't true. Isn't that amazing? But it was all a lie. In fact, you can fourcolor that map. Uh but it's is a very funny article. If you want to read it, it's in in the lecture notes or part of it is there all sorts of crazy things like oh it turns out if you take uh e and you raise it to pi time<unk> of 163, the result is an integer. It's not true. But, uh, all sorts of crazy things. Also, uh, chess has a crazy winning move. And anyway, uh, to relive the youth. All right. Um, I think I'd like to, uh, yeah, show you some examples of strong induction, but maybe first I should show you a template for applying induction. Strong induction. uh we'll repeat some of the things that I've said but I think it's good to have it concrete. So here is a template. Suppose you want to prove uh something is true for all natural numbers. So for all natural numbers n uh p of n is true. Then here's what the proof will look like. uh by proof by strong induction. Uh so generally we're assuming p of k uh for all k less than n and then we want to show p of n. Okay? Or you could shift the numbers by one but this is my preferred way of thinking about it. uh usually we prove this by cases which is the method we just saw. This is why we're pairing proof by cases with strong induction. How do we prove p of n? Well, it might depend. Often we have some base cases where n is small. So uh maybe we have to prove p of zero, maybe we have to prove p of one. Uh who knows? Let's say up to P of little B are the base cases. Maybe you have to prove those specially for some reason. Okay. Then we do an induction step. So I'll say by cases here. Uh induction step. We get to assume n is bigger than b because we just prove zero up to b manually. uh and then we need to prove in those scenarios p of n is true because uh reasons. Okay. But the the big thing here is we get to assume in in these reasons uh we get to use uh p 0 p1 up to p n minus one. Okay. So uh that's the big win. And in the base cases you don't I mean you also get to assume this but for example when you're proving P 0 you don't really get to assume anything because there are no smaller pis. Uh so often you have to do these specially because the induction step assumes somehow that n is bigger than zero. Sometimes you get lucky you just need the induction step but usually you need base cases. Let's see some examples and this will become much clearer. So let's play a game. called item stacking or it's really unstacking. So this is unstacking game. So, we're going to start with one stack of n and then a move uh splits uh stack of s bigger than one items. into two stacks with A items in one and B items in the other. And you get to choose these numbers A and B, but you need conservation. So A plus B has to equal S. And uh we also don't want zero height stack. So we need A at least one and B at least one. Okay. So you get to choose A and B however you want so long as there's at least one item in each stack. So let's take a physical example and got lots of blocks here, but I have no audience, so we're just going to demo this myself in in real life. Uh this is actually this was a snow day at MIT and so we're recording after the fact. So all the students MIT students have seen it. This is specially for you at OCW. Uh so when we do a move uh from S. So this is we have a stack of size S and we convert it into a stack of size A and a stack of size B. We get A time B points. That's just the definition of the game. A* B points. When you split into a stack of size A and a stack of size B. Uh so how should I maximize my score in this game? What's the best strategy? Uh the game ends when all your stacks have size one because you can't make a move on a stack of one item. It has to be greater than one items. So let's try here. I have a stack of five blocks. And uh one thing maybe I'll try to split it roughly in the middle. So now here I'll rotate this so you can see the blocks a little bigger. Uh these are five blocks. uh I split like this. So that's a I group of two and a group of three. Product of two * three is six. I can do this level of arithmetic. So six is our total so far. When I split this one, I get one more point. That's seven. When I split this one, doesn't matter how I do it, I get uh 2 * 1. So that's two more points. That's nine. And when I split this group, I get one more point. That's 10. Okay. So one approach gives me 10 points. What if another natural strategy that was like splitting in the middle? Another natural strategy is I just take one off each time. So if I take one off here, I get four points. Uh if I take one more off, I get three more points. That's seven. 4 + 3 is seven. I take one more off, I get two points, that's nine. I take one more off, that's one point, that's 10. Huh? 10 points that way, 10 points the other way as well. Maybe there's a theorem here. Maybe no matter what I do, I get 10 points. Well, that won't be true. But for five blocks, I will always get 10 points. For six blocks, I will always get, I don't know, 15, some more points. Uh, it turns out it doesn't matter what strategy you follow, you always get the same number of points for a given initial stack of size n. Let's prove that with strong induction. Okay. So theorem is for all natural numbers uh every strategy for this game. Uh starting uh with the stack one stack of n items scores magic formula is n * n minus one over 2. So that's the theorem and we're going to prove it by strong induction in sort of the straightforward way. So our induction hypothesis is going to be exactly the theorem statement uh for a particular n. So I'm going to highlight this statement everything except the quantifier and I'll call that p of n. So what I want to prove is for all natural numbers n P of N is true. And so that's that's just going to be our induction hypothesis. We're going to plug that into this template here. Assume that P of K is true for all K less than N and then prove P of N is true. So let's just try to do that. So what I would normally write here is assume true assume that my theorem is true. Assume P of N is true. uh sorry p of k is true for all k less than n. I would say assume true for all smaller n. Okay, let's uh we need to do something with the game. We start with a pile of size n. Let's just think about the first move. First move is something. It's takes our pile of size n and it splits it into some piles a and b. So uh we don't know what it is. We don't know what a and b are. But we can give them a name. Like this has to work no matter what a and b are. But let's say consider first move which we know we start with a pile of size n. And we produce piles of size a and b. And again uh a + b equals n and a and b are at least one. But otherwise we don't know what a and b are. Okay, so we go down to here. Um, so we now have a pile of size A and we have a pile of size B. Again, we don't know how big they are, but they are smaller than B. So I want to claim we are uh left with two piles or we can really think of those as two completely separate games A and B. We're going to get some points from splitting up A. We're going to get some points from splitting up B. They sum together, but the these piles don't really interact from here on. We got uh we got A* B points from this first step. We're going to get some points from the pile of size A. We're going to get some points to the pile of size B. How many points do we get? Uh well, in fact, our induction hypothesis will tell us because uh A and B are strictly less than N. Why? Because uh a + b= n and a and b are at least one. So there's at least one in each of a and b. And so the remainder must be strictly less than n. If there's one in a, then there'll be n minus one in b. If there's two in a, there'll be n minus two in b. In all cases, less than n. Okay? Because a and b are less than n, they're not just they're not necessarily n minus one. So we couldn't just use regular induction. But we have they're less than n. And so by strong induction uh by strong induction we know that P of A is true and P of B is true. Okay, we wrote that up here. So P of K for all K less than N. So A and B are less than N. So P of A is true and P of B are is true. So that means from the pile of size a we get uh a * a minus1 / 2 points from the a pile. We get b * b minus one over two points from the b pile. And then of course we got a time b move points uh from the first move. And so now we just need to do some algebra and add up all these points. So the total number of points that we get is a * b + a * a -1 / 2 plus b * b - 1 / 2 These two were by induction. This was the first move. Uh, and now let's just put everything over two. So this is 2 * a * b plus I don't know a^ 2 - a + b ^ 2 - b all over two. Okay. And now what do I want to get to? This is supposed to equal n * n minus one over two. And what was n? n was a plus b. So, what I'd really like to show here is uh a + b * a + b minus one over two. That's my goal. And what I need to do is fill in the in between. Uh but this is not too hard because let's see. Uh I see a time b here and a * b here. I mean in fact you can just expand this out and you'll get exactly the same thing here. uh I think slightly more intuitive is to see oh look at this term this term and this term that is uh a^2 + 2 a b + b^ 2 that is a + b^ 2 and then we have a minus a minus b over 2 but interject a rule in between we have a + b^ 2 minus a + b over 2 uh and then these two are the same thing. I think that's pretty clear. So cool. We did some algebra and the we just computed what we get out of induction and then boom, we get the answer n * n minus one over two and it works. How did we know this is the right answer? I mean, we were just told that by the theorem. Uh probably you would try this for very small n and make a conjecture. Oh, it seems like it's n * n minus one over two. Let's try to prove it. And when you assume the right thing, the proof just works. And it's kind of magical. And that's strong induction. Again, we needed strong induction here because we needed to assume uh what we wanted for all smaller n because we don't know what a and b are. This has to work for all a and b less than n. Um so luckily strong induction gives us that. All right, I have one more example to tell you about. Uh, a slightly more complicated version of the same thing. We're going to use strong induction. Don't need any of these. So, let's go. That's a problem called beat ordering. I guess somewhat relevant today because uh there's a Super Bowl, but this is just about any teams of games. Sorry, end teams in some game. And setup is that every two teams play a game and there are no ties. One team wins and the other loses. Okay, this is sort of like stranger friends and strangers uh where it's either one or the other. But in this case, it's asymmetric. It's not they're not both happy or both sad. One's happy and one is sad. Okay, this is what's called a roundroin tournament. Most sports are not played this way unless it's small number of teams because it's a lot of different teams. It's actually n * n + one over two teams uh games which is a lot. All right. So what we would like is what's called a beat ordering. Uh this is um an ordering of the teams t1 t2 up to tn such that b1 beat uh sorry t1 t for teams t1 beats t2 t2 beat t3 and so on and a TN minus one beats TN. Okay, let's draw a little example. Uh there's team rock, team scissors, and team paper. Okay, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper. Okay, this is a possible outcome in a three team tournament. There's there's not necessarily one best team here. There is no best team. But maybe paper and rock play a game and it happens that paper won. Maybe rock plays against scissors and it happens rock one and scissors played against paper. It happens scissors one. Okay, you can tell why I named the teams this way. Uh then one way I could order these teams is paper, rock, scissors because paper beats rock, rock beats scissors. Okay, so this is sort of the input and this is my goal is to produce an ordering like this. But I need to do it for n teams not just for three. Okay. So let's uh do let's do strong induction to prove that uh the theorem is a bead ordering always exists. theorem. And when I say this always exists, what I really mean is uh for all n and then for all tournaments of size n uh there exists a beat order. Okay, there exists an ordering of the end team such the first one beat the second one, second one beat the third one and so on. I should say uh for all I uh t i beat t i + one. Okay, so we claim this is true. Proof by strong induction. So we're going to assume that this statement is true. namely this statement uh is true for smaller n and then we're going to prove it for n. Okay. Uh let's pick a team any team call it t. Then I'm going to split everything with respect to t. So I'm going to define uh W to be the set of teams that win against T. So this is going to be a set of all teams S where S beat T. So this is one versus T. These teams win versus T or one versus T. And L is going to be the set of teams that lose against T. So this is the set of teams S where TBS. So this is a loss versus T. Then intuitively what we'd like to do is put the winners first, then put T, then put the losers. I claim that works. Okay. But how do I order the winners? How do I order the losers? Well, by induction. I claim uh the size of w this vertical bar means the size of the set is less than n and the size of l is less than n because uh uh the size of the winners plus the size of the losers plus one equals n. This is a one. Why? because every team is either T or they won against T or they lost against T. So this is counting all of the teams. There's T itself, the ones that win against T, the ones that lose against T. Together that ex is exactly N. Every team is exactly one of these categories. Uh and there's a plus one here. And all of these are non- negative. These here W and L might be zero, but there's this plus one. That means both W and L are strictly less than M. So the induction applies to them. So by induction uh this thing is true for any tournament of size W there exists a beat ordering of W. For every tournament of size L there exists a beat uh ordering of L. So we get a beat ordering let's we get two of them really. Uh let's call it W1 W2 dot dot dot W size of W. This is for this is an ordering of capital W. And we get L1 L2 dot dot dot L size of L as a beat ordering of capital L and then uh we concatenate. So we claim uh W1 dot dot dot W size of W then T then L1 dot dot dot L size of L is a beat ordering of all N teams. Again, this is all the teams. All the teams either won against T or they are T or they lost against T. And the idea is this part is beat. W1 beats W2. W2 beats W3 and so on by induction because this is a beat ordering of capital W. Over here, this is a beat ordering of of capital L. And so by induction, uh all these are are okay. L1 beat L2, L2 beat so on, dot dot dot beat L size of L. The only things we need to check are these two commas. We need to check that W sub big W, W subsize of W beats T and T beat L1. Why are those true? By our definition of W and L. Everything in W beat T. So this is by by the definition of W. We know that all of these beat T. So in particular, this one beat T. And we know by the definition of L, uh, all of these teams lost against T. In other words, T beats all of these teams. In particular, T beat L1. And so by combining all these beat statements together, we know that this entire thing is a beat ordering. each item beats the one right after it. So it's a little more complicated, but again, we're just quite often with strong induction proofs, you apply induction twice. You you have some problem of size n, you split it into two parts. In general, you might split it into many parts. Then you recursively solve the two parts or the many parts. As long as they're strictly smaller than n. By induction, we know they work out. By strong induction, we know they work out. You take those solutions and you combine them in some way. Here we concatenated with t in the middle. Um over here we summed them up. We summed up the number of points we got in each one plus the number of points we got in the first step. Uh and in general you combine them in some way and you prove that it's still that you're uh the thing you want to prove holds for size n and then you get your theorem. So that is the power of strong induction. Thanks.
