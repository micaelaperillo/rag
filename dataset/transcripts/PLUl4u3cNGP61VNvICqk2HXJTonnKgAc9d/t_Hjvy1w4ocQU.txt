hello can people hear me are we good in the back are we good can can people hear me good good good okay so today we are going to uh move on from counting and start the last unit on probability uh probability is uh you know very important it's one of the most important disciplines you know not just in computer science but like in in all of the Sciences uh please don't tell your other you know science instructors that I said this um you know you use it in like we've already seen it uh in this class uh with the Miller Ren algorithm uh you also see it in like you know other randomized algorithms that you'll see later in 61210 1220 5220 if you take that uh we see it in Game Theory information Theory signal processing cryptography uh machine learning medicine Stu forensics uh you know the list goes on and on uh but unfortunately it's also one of the least understood disciplines uh so there's a a pretty famous quote attributed to uh Mark Twain Benjamin Dy you know several other people uh there are three kinds of lies right there are lies there are damned lies and statistics uh so like you know you can kind of lie with probability and statistics by you know saying things that are true that are you know also very misleading uh common sense is often very demonstrably you know completely unreliable uh which you know we'll see in a in a moment uh there are many graduate students like even in our department uh again don't tell people they said this uh you know that they can they can do all sorts of exciting maths but you know you give them a basic probability question and you know they don't know where to start uh there are many garbage papers that are you know based on faulty understanding of probability uh even some of our colleagues um have some uh let's say issues um today we are going to look at uh an example um who who is sort of the Monty Hall problem oh nice decent number of people okay um so yeah well we'll basically try and use the Monty Hall problem to illustrate that you know it's it's really best to just kind of throw away your intuition and just fall back on rigorous step-by-step analyses okay so uh the the Monty Hall problem uh it kind of became famous in 1990 when uh this this magazine columnist named uh Marilyn vos Sant uh received a letter from a Craig Whitaker uh which read as follows suppose you're on a game show and you're given the choice of three doors behind one door is a car and behind the others goats you pick a door say number one and the host who knows what's behind the doors opens a different door say number three which has a goat he says to do you want to pick door number two now the question is is it to your advantage to switch okay and uh who thinks who thinks yes it is advantageous to switch who thinks no who thinks you're better off sticking with your original choice who thinks it doesn't matter okay so it looks like most people think that it's advantageous to switch uh we've had a few extensions uh I'm going to I'm going to count those as it doesn't matter uh so Marilyn replied that it's indeed advantageous to switch uh if the car is behind the originally picked door then you lose by switching but if it's not which is twice as likely then you win by switching uh and you know of course she soon received a torrent of hate mail uh including from professional mathematicians adamantly asserting that she was wrong okay uh so the the hypo that was described in this letter became known as the Monty Hall problem uh you know after the the host Monty Hall of the game show which you know had games like this uh where where you know contestants faced very similar situations uh so today we're going to analyze it but first can I get uh a handful of volunteers to come play Let's Make a Deal okay so empirically at least it looks like it's better to switch right like you know most people uh switched and you know most people won the prize when they did that uh so you know even though there's only one door with the prize it it seems to be pretty promising right so let's see if we can analyze this mathematically okay so we're going to solve the Monty Hall problem using what we call it the the tree method which is a very simple and Elementary uh approach uh that doesn't rely on intuition it's just going to rely on mathematical break okay so the tree method uses 4ish steps uh we used to call it the four step method but like I couldn't for the life of me tell you what the four steps are if if uh you know they weren't written in front of me uh so you know I prefer to call it the tree method uh oh I can't even count it kind of has five steps we've got like a Step Zero before you even start right you really want to make sure that you are like you know what question you're trying to answer okay so before we can even think about uh solving a mathematical problem we we need to know what the problem is okay uh we we we need to to understand the setup make sure we know what we're trying to ask uh you know before we can start analyzing it so the the letter from from this uh Mr Whitaker was not entirely precise Okay so we've got to kind of figure out what axium we're working with okay so we're going to assume the following uh prize is equally likely to be in any box okay so you know in principle it's possible that uh you know Monty Hall tries to be tricky and you know tries to you know get into the contestants Minds figure out what box they're going to pick and like put the price somewhere else or you know alternatively put the pricee somewhere where they will pick it because it's an exciting game show um but you know we're going to assume that you know Monty is just you know picking the boxes randomly okay so the the prize is going to go into into a randomly selected box like completely uniform and then the other two will have the goats okay we're also going to assume that Marilyn or you know your colleagues whoever is is doing the picking is equally likely to pick any ebx okay so for the for the first pick okay uh she doesn't know anything about what Monty is doing she's just going to you know toss some random coins in her head and you know uniformly at random she'll just pick one of the boxes it doesn't really matter where the where the price is okay now after Marilyn picks her her box right Monty must reveal a non prise okay and moreover it cannot be in Maryland's box okay so you know all that all that Mr Whitaker said was right Monty did reveal a non prize that wasn't uh you know behind the chosen door uh it's not entirely clear that this must happen and in fact I believe on the game show there were instances where you know he didn't right um so we're just going to assume that you know Monty is going to reveal a prize you know regardless of whether picked the correct uh correct box to begin with okay and lastly if Monty has a choice he picks randomly okay so if Marilyn has you know picked a non-price to begin with right there's only one other non priz so so Monty has to reveal that one but if Marilyn has picked the the prize box to begin with then Monty could in principle open either of the other two boxes that would still follow this role okay so when Monty has a choice like this we're going to say that you know he tosses a coin and he's going to you know open one of them at random okay so note that these are all axioms okay we are just you know taking them on faith they may or may not have Merit but if you accept them then you also have to accept whatever conclusions we draw uh from them okay uh but you know I should point out that there are other perfectly reasonable sets of axioms uh that would lead us to different conclusions right like maybe Monty is you know very rude and if Marilyn has you know uh has picked the prize then he offers her the option to switch and if Marilyn has not picked the prize then he forces her to go with whatever she picked okay you know like this this is you know a totally reasonable uh interpretation uh and that would lead us to to a different conclusion okay or you know conversely maybe as benevolent maybe if Marilyn uh maybe if Marilyn didn't pick the prize initially he'll always you know try and encourage her to switch uh but if she picked the prize he'll just be like nope you got to stick with that okay so now that we've got these axioms we can now pose the mathematical question uh what is the probability that Marilyn wins by switching so uh yes um this is why I I singled you out I I don't know where where you've gone um you your colleague who who did not switch uh you know we're trying to analyze this probability which is which is why single you want so I apologize for that but you know it's for the mouths don't take it personally uh okay so now we have you know a well- defined question right so now we can analyze it using the four step method the first of our four steps well the tree method which has four steps uh we need to figure out what we call the sample space okay uh so whenever we're thinking about a probability problem uh underlying it is always what we call a probability space okay and a probability space consists of two things uh these two elements are a set right which we call the sample space okay and you know for the purposes of this class we're we're only going to be looking at discrete probability spaces so uh s is going to be a non-empty and countable or finite uh set we're not going to look at sets like r or something like that okay so you know this could be uh you know a set of three boxes or it could be you know the natural numbers something like that something that's you know discret and countable uh and then we also have a function which we're going to denote by the letters PR R which Maps s into the unit interval 0 to one okay so this this is going to be a total function with uh probably shouldn't use S here let's call it X okay uh and you know slightly oddly when we're talking about probabilities we use square brackets instead of uh parenthesis uh to enclose the argument um but uh you know this is just a function you can think of it as like PR of X okay uh so we're going to have the requirement that if you sum up PR of X over all of the X in your sample space you should get one okay that's what it means for this to be a probability function okay oh actually why don't we leave both of these up and move on to this board okay so this is called our probability function and uh elements of s are what uh we're going to call those outcomes Okay Okay so we've got a sample space s which is a set of outcomes and we've got a probability function which Maps each outcome to a number between Z and one okay and it should be the case that all of those probabilities should sum to one does that make sense to everybody people people reasonably happy with this questions comments concerns okay so our first objective is going to be to figure out what our sample space should be okay so we're going to do that using what we call a tree diagram okay so for the moment we're going to disregard the probability function and just focus on S okay and then once we figured out what s is we can figure out how to assign probabilities to everything okay so the tree diagram you know as you might expect it's going to be a diagram in the shape of a tree where each level of the tree represents some step in the random process we're trying to model okay so in the case of the Monty Hall problem what might be the first step like what's what's the first thing that happens in the Monty Hall problem the the first like source of Randomness yeah uh okay there's there's something random that happens even before that the answer was you pick a door yeah yeah so the the first random thing that happens right is I or or Monty picks which store the prize uh the priz is behind Okay so that's going to be the first level of our tree diagram okay so let's start drawing out our tree diagram we're going to have our root here and let's label this with you know Monty hides price okay and we're going to have three edges which go to you know the three possibilities for what happens here okay so it could be in door a door B actually why don't I call these you know purple gold and silver uh where's the Eraser here we go Okay so we've got our purple box our gold box and our Silver Box okay uh what's the next random thing that happens yeah yeah yeah so as as your colleague said last time you know the the next random thing that happens is Marilyn or you know the contestant picks a door okay so um oh dear Monty and Marlin both begin with the same letter okay let's just call this student okay so now each of these is going to split into you know three more possibilities okay so you know our contestant can pick purple gold or silver okay for each of these these three things right regardless of where Monty has hidden the prize the contestant can pick you know any of the uh any of the doors okay okay what's the next random thing that could happen yeah were you raising your hand oh no no okay yeah so if Monty has a choice of of door to reveal then he picks one of the one of the two remaining doors randomly okay so so far we've got three branches where that could happen right we've got uh you know both Monty and and uh Marilyn picked door P okay so in that case Monty can reveal either G or S okay so let's uh you know make uh make a branch for that uh similarly if they both pick G we could have either P or S and if they both pick s then here we could have either P or G okay now for the remaining ones right like we we could you know say that uh there's a random process there where Monti is you know randomly picking from a single element set so you know it's always going to be the same thing we could consider it a random outcome though so we can also draw these arrows here okay uh uh kind of running out of space here so let's uh put this up here let's label it on this board so Monty reveals a zon so this is the uh technical term for a non prize I think the uh the non prizes on Monty's show were called zonks uh that they weren't always goats you know some times it was uh you know something some other sort of ridiculous prize like a garbage can or a potato or something um but yeah they were just called songs uh okay so now are we done is there any other Randomness that we haven't modeled yet who thinks yes oh okay so what are we missing then everybody seems to think we're missing somebody or are we just asleep it is very early in the morning I understand uh are we missing anything who thinks we're not missing anything few hands okay uh well yeah turns out that this is all of the all of the randomness um you know you could think about uh a different problem right where where Marilyn has a random strategy but for now we're just you know our question right is you know Marilyn's always going to switch what's the probability that she wins okay so this is all the randomness that we've got so now now that we have our tree structure we can label our outcomes okay and that'll tell us what the set s is so the set s is just going to be the set of leaves of our tree okay each you know path right corresponds to you know some way that the random process could turn out right those are going to be our outcomes okay so formally we could label these as tuples so let's say that this one's PPG right so that represents you know Monty hides the prize behind door P Marilyn picks door p and then Monty reveals a zon behind uh door G okay this one's going to be PPS this one's going to be PG and now I haven't actually labeled The Edge uh but you know if Monty hides the the prize behind door p and then uh Marilyn picks door G where is Monty revealing the zon s yeah so let's uh label that okay and you know we can continue all the way down okay so s oh I've just realized that I've overloaded it it's it's a script DES in my notes and so it looks different I'm I'm I'm sorry uh okay so our squiggly s is going to be the set of all tuples uh so x y z in uh PG s uh oops cubed right so it's going to be triples of you know PG and S such that uh Z is not equal to X and Zed is not equal to Y okay so that's how we're you know mathematically going to represent our sample space okay so X is the door that that Monty hides the the prize behind Y is the door that Marilyn initially chooses and then Z is going to be the the door that Monty reveals which has a goat and by our rule that door cannot be either of the first two okay but anything else is a valid outcome okay do we have any questions about the sample space and and how we computed it okay so our next step now that we've got our sample space we want to figure out our probability function okay so we'd like to figure out what the probability of each of these outcomes is okay so to do this we're going to assign a probability to every Edge that we've got in our tree diagram okay uh and so that's that's just going to be the probability that you know if we get to the source of that edge you know what's the probability that we uh you know proceed along that edge okay so at the very beginning right if we're at the root what's the probability that you know given that we're at the start Monty hides the uh the prize behind door uh P yeah one3 yeah so we're going to label this with one3 okay what about G what's the probability that Monty hides the uh prize behind door G anybody okay I mean yeah arithmetic is pretty difficult but uh I I'll just do it for you it's also 1/3 okay and uh the probability that Monty hide sit behind door s also a third okay yeah question yeah that's a great observation so all of these three probabilities should add up to one right because if we're at this this uh vertex here we should proceed somewhere right uh so like you know it it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to have like you know probability 1/3 probability 2/3 and probability one right because then you're like like you have to proceed down this path but then you also have to proceed down one of the others like it's it's a bit sticky okay so given that you're at this this vertex you've got to reach a leaf somehow you you've got to get to some outcome so you've got to proceed okay so you know all of these edges should uh should sum up to one great observation uh it's not quite true though that that holds for the entire column okay so what happens if we look at the next column so given that Monty hides the prize behind door P what's the probability that Marilyn then picks DP any ideas yeah one3 yeah so Marilyn picks this with probability 1/3 right like Marilyn doesn't know or care what's going on with where the prize actually is she's just picking each door with probability 1/3 you know regardless Okay so we've kind of got the same thing going on here each of these three edges has probability 1/3 but now the same holds true for this Branch right if Monty has hidden the door or hidden the prize behind door G you know the same logic applies right Marilyn's still picking each door with probability 1/3 Okay so we've also got 1/3 here 1/3 here 1/3 here okay so it's not quite that all of the uh edges in a column add up to one but all of the edges coming out of a single vertex add up to one okay and same thing for this bottom Branch okay now what about the last column if Monty has hidden the prize behind door p and Marilyn has also picked door p what's the probability that we get to outcome PPG yeah one half that's right okay and it's also half whoops that's not a two that's a three there we go 1 half okay so probability one half for each of them okay we've got probability one/ half that uh that the zon behind G is revealed probability one half that the zon behind s is revealed okay and as we were saying before uh if Monty hides the prize behind p and Marilyn picks G Monty now has no choice okay so we're just going to say that this is probability one okay and same with this one this one also has one uh PSG okay and similarly for the other three branches so we've got one 1/2 1/2 one one one 1/2 and2 okay so did these Edge probabilities make sense to everybody okay so now remember what the probability function was right right uh we have to assign a probability to every outcome okay the outcomes right are the leaves of our tree not the edges okay so what is the probability that we end up with outcome PPG for instance yeah 1 18th and how are you getting that yeah 1/3 * 1/3 * 1/3 okay we're going to multiply together all of the probabilities along the path from the route to that to that leaf okay so Monty hides the prize behind door p with probability 1/3 and then you know conditioned on that happening Marilyn then picks door p with probability 1/3 so then there's probability 1 nth that we make it to this vertex here and now that one ninth is split again among these two outcomes okay does that make sense to everybody so if we do that for every outcome we've got uh oops 1/ 18th not 1/8 another 1/ 18th for PPS then what about pgs yeah yeah it's just one nth okay so same deal for the first two layers but then in the last layer we've just got a probability of one we don't have to split again so it's it remains at 1 nth okay and you know once again we can continue we've got uh 1 nth here 11 18th 11 18th 1 n and we can continue okay so we're going to justify this more formally later but uh you know for now just take it on faith that in order to get the uh probability of an outcome uh you multiply together the probabilities along the path to that outcome okay like hopefully it at least makes intuitive sense uh but you know we'll we'll reason about it more formally later okay so now we have our sample space we have our probability function so we've got the entire probability space that we're that we're trying to reason about okay uh the next thing that we want we want to figure out what what we call events we care about okay so an event is simply a subset of our sample space okay so it's it's a set of outcomes [Music] so up here right we could think about the event that Marilyn wins okay so what is that formally as a set yeah yeah exactly so the answer was it's the subset of events where X and Y are different so the notation that we usually use for events is is the following okay we you know put the description of the event in square brackets so this is just going to be the set right pgs PS g g PS GSP uh s GP s PG okay so the six outcomes right where uh Marilyn and Monty originally pick different doors and then Monty is forced to reveal the uh the last one okay similarly we could also Define you know other events like uh you know uh Monty opens uh door P okay so this is going to be the Set uh g g p uh s s p uh GSP and SGP okay so does this make sense to everybody like any subset of events uh or sorry any subset of outcomes is called an event uh we can kind of take our English description and then look at which actual outcomes uh this corresponds to okay so what we want to do now is figure out what event we care about or possibly what events okay so what are the events that we care about for this problem anybody what was the probability that we're trying to compute yeah pardon yeah so that the events Marilyn wins and Marilyn loses right these are the events we care about okay so uh you know we could say Marilyn loses is you know the compx of Maryland WIS which we denote with an over bar okay so these are the two events we care about okay so the final step is to compute the answer okay we've identified the event that we care about okay so now we want to figure out the probability that that event occurs okay so we can extend the probability function to events so if e is an event right we can think about the probability of an event just as we think about the probability of outcomes and we're going to Define this to be the sum over all outcomes Omega and E of the probability of Omega okay so you know hopefully intuitively that makes sense right like all of these outcomes uh you know exactly one outcome is is going to happen so if we're trying to figure out the probability that you know one of a set of outcomes happens it's just going to be you know the the sum of the probabilities that that each individual one occurs okay so we know the probabilities of each of the outcomes right that's what we just computed here so now we can use that to compute the probability of the events we just uh we just talked about okay so what is the probability that Marilyn wins so we have our set of outcomes here what's the probability of each one oh what's what's the probability of outcome pgs yeah one n yeah that one's written up up there explicitly uh what about the probability of PSV same 1 nth okay what about the probability of GPS also a nth right like you know all of these are symmetric okay what's that 2/3 okay so we've got six events or six outcomes Each of which occurs with probability 1 nth so if you add those all together you get 2/3 okay so this seems to support you know what we found empirically right Marilyn wins with better than probability 1/2 right the probability that she loses is going to be the complement of this okay so it's going to be the uh sum of the probabilities of all of the other outcomes right and we said that all probabilities uh should add to one so this is going to be you know the complement with respect to one okay so as it turns out Marilyn was correct okay we didn't have to rely on Intuition or anything like that no ingenious analogies Etc it's just you know arithmetic over Q okay and I think the the hardest part of this for many people is resisting the temptation to jump jump to some sort of like obvious conclusion right like you know it might be tempting to you know get to the end of the tree diagram and be like oh we've got six outcomes where Marilyn wins six where she loses so probably you know 6 over 12 is2 right so if we actually you know set all of that you know intuition aside go through everything formally it's all you know quite simple and straightforward okay so that makes sense to everybody okay so let's move on to a different example suppose I have three strange dice okay so excuse my drawing whoops nothing there okay so I've got one die that has two written on two of the faces so you know top and bottom uh six written on you know these two faces and seven written on those two faces okay hopefully that you know looks vaguely cubical okay I've got a second ey which is similar uh but instead of 2 six and seven I've got 1 5 and nine then I've got a third one which has three four and eight okay so consider the following game okay uh I pick a die right now you pick one of the uh other dies after or dice after seeing what I pick and we each roll our dice okay and whoever gets the higher number wins okay who should win should I win or should you win who thinks I win okay who thinks you win who thinks we should just uh you know do the tree diagram and figure it out yeah good call okay so let's let's call these dice like r g and B okay so yeah let's let's draw out our tree diagram okay so what happens if say I pick the red D and uh you pick the green Dy okay who should win let's let's see so we've got when I roll my die right there are three possibilities I could either get a two a six or a seven and now you roll the green D and you could have either a one a five or a nine not minus 5 five 1 5 9 five okay and now what is the probability or sorry what what are the uh what are the outcomes we have nine leaves so nine outcomes how are we going to represent them well we can do it basically the same as how we uh represented them up here right we can uh just look at a tupal of uh Edge labels okay so our some space is going to be the Set uh 267 uh cartisian product with uh 159 okay so this is going to be ordered pairs where the first element is one of these three things and the second is one of these three things okay so this one for instance is 2 comma 1 this one is 2A 5 Etc okay now what are the probabilities on each Edge yeah 1 nth uh so those are the uh probabilities on the outcomes yeah one3 on each Edge right okay so when I roll my die I've got a one3 chance each of getting two six or seven when you roll yours you've got a 1/3 chance each of getting five or n okay and you know it's going to be the same for the other two branches so when we multiply together the probabilities uh along paths to leaves we get 1 nth for every outcome okay so when you have a probability space like this that's particularly nice this is what we call a uniform probability space uh so let's say s comma p r so this is our probability space is uniform if uh PR is constant okay so in this this case it's a constant function that Maps every outcome to a probability of 1 nth okay so it's a uniform probability space okay and uh uniform spaces are particularly nice because you know we don't even have to worry about the addition that we were doing before like in order to figure out probabilities of uh of events you just count up how many outcomes are in the event and then divide by the total number of outcomes okay so it just becomes a counting problem so using that what's the probability that red wins yeah 5 9ths yeah so let's break this down a bit so we're looking at the probability of the set right 2 comma 1 red wins 6165 red wins and 7175 red wins okay so 21 uh 75 we have five of these so that's 5 over 9 okay now what if instead we had red versus blue instead of red versus green so if instead of red versus green we have red versus blue this column now gets replaced with 348 instead of okay so our tree diagram is going to look like the following so we've still got uh 267 here but this time this is going to be 3 348 3 okay and I'm going to omit the probabilities because we just established it's uniform so it's just a counting problem but let's write down the outcomes okay so in how many of these outcomes does red win well not this one right not this one not this one okay so if red rolls two right all of Blue's uh all of Blue's uh numbers are going to be higher so blue is always going to win uh if red rolls six uh red wins if blue Rolls three or four loses if uh blue Rolls eight and same for seven okay so we have uh four outcomes where red wins so red wins with probability four nths okay so we just saw that uh red beats Green but loses to Blue what does that tell us about blue and green if I pick blue and you pick Green what happens who wins yeah Green why okay so green Beats red uh so I think we just established that red beats screen right so here we've got you know red beat screen here we've got red loses to Blue so if we have uh green and blue who thinks that green should win who thinks that blue should win who has absolutely no idea who wants to do the tree diagram oh still pretty enthusiastic about that even though we've got some intuition that's great intuition is bad dis SC the intuition okay so if we've got green versus blue so this can be the uh green roll here we've got uh 159 blue roll can be uh 3 48 3 48 3 48 okay uh so in which of these does green win well if green rolls one then you know Green is screwed so all of these are bad for green uh if green rolls five well five will beat three and four but not eight so green wins these two and if green rolles nine then green Beats you know whatever blue rolls okay okay so it looks like green is winning in five of these okay so this should be like that okay so red beats green green Beats blue and blue Beats red what's gone wrong yeah pardon yeah so nothing's gone wrong all that's gone wrong is uh you know I I kind of expected that there would be a linear order on them right right like uh you know if red beats green and green Beats blue it kind of intuitively makes sense that red should beat blue right no no no intuition just do the tree diagram uh so yeah this is perfectly fine right and in fact it gets even weirder right uh what do you think happens if uh we each choose two dice or sorry we each roll twice so what if uh you know what if I pick the red dy I roll it twice you pick the green Dy you roll it twice right red probably beats Green so is it true that two red rolls probably beat two green rolls like if we sum them up who thinks yes who thinks no who wants to draw the tree diagram oh wow so eager I don't um like uh what is the tree diagram going to look like if we if we do that like I'm rolling twice you're rolling twice each roll can have you know three possible uh uh three possibilities right so we're going to end up with a pretty massive tree I I don't want to draw that at least not on the board does somebody else want to come up and do it please no nobody okay well instead of drawing out the entire tree diagram let's kind of start drawing it and see if we can find a pattern okay so this is uh R2 versus G2 okay [Music] so let's start by know drawing as we did before okay so my first roll as was red could be 2 six or 7 second rle could also be 2 six or okay now for green right we're basically just going to be drawing the same tree nine times so you know let's not so green could roll you know 159 and then can also roll 159 for the second roll okay and rather than duplicating this three nine times I'm just going to leave this as it is and you know we can see if we can find a pattern okay does that make sense to everybody so an outcome now is going to be a four tupal right instead of a pair and in some sense we can kind of think of it as combining a leaf of this tree with a leaf of this tree okay we're going to take a red leaf and a green leaf a question or no no okay okay [Music] so we can then abbreviate it even further right instead of looking at the pair of numbers that we've that we've rolled let's instead look at you know just the SU okay so if red rolls two tws we've got four here 2 and six is eight 2 and 7 is N9 uh 6 2 is 8 uh 66 is not 9 that's 12 ever trust me to do arithmetic uh 67 is 13 72 is 9 76 is 13 77 is okay and if we do do the same thing for uh green we have 2 6 10 6 10 14 10 14 okay so now we can start counting outcomes if we take this Leaf of the red tree how many outcomes are there where red wins if red rolls four in total the only way that red wins is if green gets Snake Eyes Okay so we've just got one if red rules eight which could be either of these two how many outcomes are there where red wins well we've got a two here a six here and a six here so we've got three and we've got uh two red leaves that have eight uh what about nine it looks like we've got two more that have nine same deal right we don't have any eights or nines over on this side okay uh what else do we have okay well if red rolls 12 then red is good if blue Rolls 2 6 10 but not 14 or 18 so we've got 1 2 3 4 five six outcomes and we have one red leaf where red has 12 okay then same thing for 13 there are no 12 or 13s over here and we have two 13s now what about 14 well if red rolls 14 then you know same deal but we've got these two ties here okay so red winds draw we've just got two and then red loses is going to be the complement okay so has anybody added all of these up yet I haven't 5 30 42 43 is that right so 43 outcomes for red wins uh had something wrong this doesn't match my notes uh let's see so we've got one for this sub tree for each of these we have three for each of the nines we also have three so that's those 12 13 and 13 oh do I just have too many terms I just have too many terms okay not 43 it should be 37 is that right yeah are 12 13 13 and 14 each have six okay okay uh yeah never trust me to do arithmetic it's always a bad plan uh okay so red wins in 37 of the outcomes right there's a draw in two of them and how many outcomes are there in total yeah1 yeah 81 so red loses in 81 - 37 - which is that 42 I think that's 42 okay so because this is uniform space we have 37 over 81 42 over 81 which is going to be well actually let's not reduce it it's easier to see like that and two out of 81 for a draw okay so if we only had one role red had the advantage right red wins with probability 5 9ths if we have two roles right the probability that red wins is smaller than the probability that red loses so now suddenly green has the advantage instead okay and um as it turns out you know the same thing happens with all three pairs of dice right so uh you know red beats Green with with one roll green Beats blue with one roll but Blue Beats Green with two rolls right and Blue Beats red with with one roll but red beats blue with two rolls and uh yeah so the the the dice continue to you know not have this transitivity property but like every time it's switched okay and as it turns out uh you know you can even you know extend this right right like if you have more dice with different numbers you can get like all sorts of weird things that are that are that that could happen um so there's a a link to a to a a rather interesting paper on archive if you if you want to see it uh in the lecture notes um but uh yeah for now I think that's all we have time for feel free to uh come up if you have questions and otherwise we will see you on Thursday
