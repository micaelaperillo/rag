hello can people hear me in the back yeah thumbs up okay uh so today we're going to be continuing our discussion of uh probability uh in the last lecture we saw uh how to compute probabilities using the uh oh dear uh using the uh tree method and this lecture we are going to uh you know see how some of the tools that we learned in the last unit for counting uh for for reasoning about the sizes of sets and things like that can also carry over naturally into the uh into the realm of probability okay uh and we'll also learn how to express mathematically uh statements like uh if you recall I was saying things last time like you know if the prize is behind door a what is the probability that uh Marilyn selects door b or or something like that okay so we're going to uh you know see you know more formally what these statements are are trying to express and how to reason about them okay so uh recall how we Define the probability of an event a so an event is just a set of outcomes uh our probability function PR is a function from uh the set of outcomes the sample space uh to the interval 0 to 1 and we can can extend this naturally to events by saying that the probability of an event is just the sum of the probabilities of all of the outcomes in that event okay so an immediate consequence of this definition or several immediate consequences I suppose are the following so first we have the sum rule so if we have two events uh A and B and they're disjoint so A and B are disjoint of events this tells us that the probability of the Union of A and B is what what do we think that is any ideas yeah yeah the sum of the probabilities so probability of a plus the probability of B okay so very similar to what we saw with sets if you have two disint sets the size of their Union is the same as as the uh sum of the individual sizes the same thing happens with probability okay uh we also have the complement rule so if we have some event a what do we think the probability of the complement of a is so the probability that a does doesn't occur oh I should probably yeah what's the probability of not a anybody yeah yeah one minus the probability of a okay right because uh a and not a are disjoint and one of them must happen so you know with certainty uh one of a or not a happens so the probability of their Union is one so this kind of just follows from the sum rule okay what else do we have uh the difference rule okay so in this case suppose we have uh again two events a and B and this time we'd like to look at the difference a set minus B what do we think that might be in terms of the probabilities of A and B yeah exactly so the probability of a minus the probability of the intersection okay and why is that well a is just the disjoint Union of a minus b and a intercept B okay uh we also have an analog of principle of uh inclusion exclusion so the probability of uh a union B for more General A and B so you know they're not necessarily disjoint anymore just like we had with sets this is going to be the probability of a plus the probability of B minus the probability of the intersection okay and we have a couple of um new uh rules that don't really have analoges in in the case of uh uh like in the case of counting sets so first we have the union Bond oops so probability of a union B it's less than or equal to probability of a plus probability of b or I suppose I shouldn't say it doesn't really have an analog but we didn't really look at the analog okay and why might that be the case yeah oh yeah uh so uh the question is what's the difference between the sum Rule and Pi so so in the sum rule we assume that A and B are disjoint okay so if a and b are disjoint then their intersection is is empty so the intersection has zero probability so Pi is just a way to generalize uh the the sum rule okay to to the case where they're they're not necessarily disjoint anymore they may have a non-trivial intersection okay good question any other questions no okay so can anybody give a reason why the union bound might be true yeah yeah so the answer was the probability of the intersection is not negative right so uh you know if we just take PI right so this holds you know with equality and now if we just you know get rid of this negative term here we can only increase the uh the probability because all probabilities have to be between zero and one okay uh we also have monotonicity again I don't think we uh you know saw an analogue of this with sets but uh you know if a is a subset of B what do you think that tells us about the uh probabilities and ites I'm I'm seeing some uh hand motions so as you might expect from the name if a is a subset of B then its probability should be smaller than the the probability of B okay so do these make uh do these make sense to everybody okay so just as we saw with uh with sets uh both the sum rule the union bound and uh principle of inclusion exclusion can all generalize to you know arbitrary numbers of of uh events uh or even you know countably many okay uh I suppose principle of inclusion exclusion you should probably only think about you know finite cases but the other two are you know they fairly naturally generalize to uh to countable sets of events okay so do these rules make sense to everybody he'll probably be using them quite a lot so uh you know make sure you're familiar with them any questions okay so in that case let us move on to the main topic of today's lecture conditional probability okay so if you recall on Tuesday when we were talking about the Monty Hall problem when we were drawing a tree diagram right um we were making statements such as you know if the car is behind door one what's the probability that we picked door two or I guess it was you purple gold and green uh purple gold silver silver yeah uh so how do we express this mathematically uh so that's where conditional probability comes in we're going to make use of the following definition okay so if we have two events A and B uh we Define the conditional probability of a given B okay uh which we denote as the following so we' say uh you know a conditioned on B right we denote that with a vertical bar we Define this to be the probability of a intersect B divided by the probability of B okay so intuitively you can kind of think of it a little bit as uh you know we're trying to scale our probability space so that you know B becomes our entire entire sample space okay so we kind of want to divide out this this probability of B uh so that you know we still get a a probability space all of the probabilities sum to one okay does that kind of make sense to everybody and then you know the analog of a right we're you know only looking at everything that that's already within B so we're looking at the intersection of A and B okay now if we rewrite this we can get a product rule right so if we want to know the probability of a intercept B we can kind of just move this probability of B over to the other side and we end up with probability of a intersect b equals probability of a given B times the probability of B okay and as you might expect you can extend this to multiple events or I guess this is already kind of multiple events you can extend it to more than two events so you can also have EG the probability of a intercept B intercept C equals probability of a given being T times the probability of B uh or maybe I should write this out more explicitly B intercept C okay and then if we apply our uh apply our binary product rule again we can kind of expand out that uh this term as the probability of a given B and C probability of B given C probability of C okay so that's basically what we were doing on Tuesday you know written out more formally right so uh like probability of C corresponds to you know what is the first Edge we chose you know the the first Edge going away from the root okay and then conditioned on reaching a particular vertex like conditioned on you know Monty hiding the prize in the gold box you know what's the probability that Marilyn chooses the silver one okay so that's the conditional probability of choosing the Silver Box conditioned on the the prize being in the gold box okay and then you know as you continue along the uh uh along the path to a leaf uh all of the edge probabilities that you're looking at are secret like they were secretly just you know basic additional probabilities okay does that make sense to everybody any questions okay so another extension of this that you may find useful is the following a intersect B given C is going to be probability of a given B intercept C probability of B given C okay so can anybody see why that might be the case well first maybe we should look at you know what exactly is it saying okay so if you kind of squint a little bit and get rid of the C's right it kind of looks a little bit like the product rule right a intercept B is probability a given B times probability of B okay it it looks kind of like that right but we've added a bunch of C's everywhere so basically what we're saying here is this is the product rule in the probability space where we're you know assuming C like it's it's the product rule conditioned on C okay does that make sense to everybody and we can you know obtain it from the from the previous line just by dividing out by the probability of C okay do people have questions are we happy to move on to some examples yeah sorry uh okay so the question was are we talking about sets or events uh yes uh so remember that uh events are defined to be sets of outcomes right so uh you know we're talking about events but you know events are sets and we can treat them as such so that's why we're using uh lots of notation here that you would typically associate with sets like Union intersection Etc okay any other questions oh yeah ah uh so these are not nodes in the tree um some of uh sorry question was if we have an event that's like a union B Union C or something uh are these General sets or are they nodes in in the tree um that is a good observation some of the nodes in the tree kind of naturally correspond to events right like uh you know if we draw out our tree diagram this node here fairly naturally corresponds to this set of events like or sorry this set of outcomes those those two uh leaves in its sub tree uh but not every event necessarily corresponds to an internal node of the tree like that like for instance you could have these two uh outcomes right uh if you you know consider the set of those two outcomes that's still a valid event but it doesn't really naturally correspond to a a a tree Noe in the same way does that make sense oh that that is quite possible okay um so asking about the conditional probabilities as they appear in the tree uh yes oh I see okay uh so I guess the the way that I like to think about uh a given B um it is an event in a different probability space so you can kind of think of uh you know if you limit uh the scope rather rather than you know talking about your entire sample space s if you limit the the scope to just C so you like scale all of the probabilities down by by the probability of C you you end up with a different probability space so now the probability of or sorry the event you know be given C is an event in that probability space does that make sense okay yeah sorry thank you for the clarification okay so why don't we move on to some examples then if uh if this makes you know reasonable amount of sense hopefully it'll make more sense after examples okay so uh you know suppose Ash and Gary are having a bunch of Pokemon battles against each other and you know they're doing like a tournament the the first to win two battles uh wins the uh the or I guess the series the first to win two battles wins the series okay and uh you know the the probability is of Victor are not you know entirely uniform so for the first match you know maybe it's a toss up okay Ash wins with probability one2 Gary wins with probability one half okay uh but after the first battle there's kind of an advantage to whoever won the last battle like you know their their their morale is high or something they they do better so they now have probability of 2/3 uh of winning the next battle okay and there aren't there aren't any draws uh they're bitter Rivals they will fight to the death um okay so let's define a couple of events we'll say that a is the event Ash wins oops the series and B is the event uh Ash wins the first battal okay so now we can ask for the probability of a given B okay so does does the problem setup make sense yeah okay so how could we compute this any ideas where do we want to start should we just throw some numbers out there oh yeah yeah let's draw a tree diagram nice one okay so drawing a tree diagram what's the first you know random thing that happens what's the what's the first source of Randomness yeah yeah so F could win or lose the first battle so we can actually label these as B and not B okay what's the next random thing that could happen yeah yeah that's right so actually maybe it's better to call these just W and L so we can use the same thing everywhere so win lose win lose regardless of uh whether he wins or loses the first battle you can still either win or lose the second one Okay now what's the third layer going to be exactly yeah exactly okay so if he's one two or lost two those are just leaves now we don't do anything more the series is over okay but if he's won one and lost one in either order we can now split again oops that's a little bit long but oh well WL WL okay so now what are our outcomes again let's look at the uh uh paths from from root to leaves and just you know label with a uh a string of edge labels so this is going to be W comma w w l w w l l l w w l w l and l l okay now what are the probabilities on each of the edges so in the first layer what's the probability that Ash wins the first game first match yeah2 so each of these say probability one2 okay now the second layer we said are now conditional probabilities so conditioned on winning the first match what's the probability of winning the second match what's the probability on this edge here do we remember 2/3 yeah and so the other branch is going to be the complement of that so 1/3 okay and then for the bottom Branch it's going to be exactly the opposite okay it's going to be one3 chance of winning 2/3 chance of losing okay now conditioned on winning the first match and losing the second match what's the probability of winning the third yeah one3 yeah so 1/3 win 2/3 loss and uh this will be uh exactly the opposite so 2/3 win 1/3 loss okay so now we can assign probabilities to all of the outcomes okay what's the probability of winning twice how do we compute these probabilities anyone yeah uh oh so that this was uh just you know what we assumed in the problem right if uh if it's not the first game uh you win with probability 2/3 if you won the last game or with probability 1/3 if you lost the last game okay so the the first branch is 50/50 but the subsequent ones are going to be 2/3 1/3 in One Direction or the other depending on the outcome of the previous game maybe I shouldn't use outcome depending on the result of the previous game okay okay so how do we compute probabilities of outcomes does anybody remember yeah yeah so you multiply probabilities along paths two outcomes okay so for this top outcome right we've got uh 1/2 * 2/3 so this is probability 1/3 uh win loss win has probability 1/3 by/ 12 by 1/3 so that's 118th uh when loss loss is probability 1/2 * 1/3 * 2/3 so that's going to be 1 nth uh and then these all reverse 11 18th and 13 have I done that correctly yes that looks fine if I make an error please shout at me uh okay so we've got all of the uh we've got our tree diagram we've got our sample space we've got our our probability function uh what's the next thing we need do we remember so we've got step one the tree step two the uh probabilities three right was the events of Interest okay so what are the events we care about here yeah pardon okay winning the tournament and winning the first game okay so uh a was uh y a was winning the tournament B was winning the first game uh is that all are there any other events that we care about yeah yes exactly so we also want a intersect B okay we also care about the event where you win the first battle and the series why is that would you like to explain or yeah exactly so ultimately we want this conditional probability right the probability of a given B and if we go back to our definition right the probability of a given B is the probability of a intersect B divided by the probability of B okay so as it turns out we kind of don't really need a right the two probabilities we really need are these two or the two events I suppose okay so finally for answer what is our answer well probability of a given b as we just said is the probability of a intersect B divide by probability of B okay what are each of these probabilities well which events or sorry which outcomes are in the event a intersect B it's ww in a intercept B yeah win loss win also yes okay win loss loss nope and all of these he lost the first game so these are also not in it so we care about these two uh these two outcomes okay so this is going to be by the sum rule 1/3 +/ 18 that doesn't look much like an eight oh well okay now what's the probability of B yeah yeah it's just one half right either by symmetry or you can actually look at what those outcomes are right it's these top uh these top three okay and if we do this arithmetic we've got 7/8 divided 12 which is 7 nths okay so the probability that Ash wins the entire series given that he won the first battle is going to be 79ths okay so so far this is pretty straightforward right fairly routine uh mathemat well arithmetic but what if instead we ask for the probability of B given a what is that probability well numerically right we can compute it in exactly the same way right it's going to be the probability of the intersection divided by this time the probability of a rather than the probability of B but still by symmetry that probability is going to be2 okay so this is also going to be 7 9ths but what exactly does it mean yeah yeah so the answer was you know given that you already won the series what's the probability that he won the first battle okay now this might sound a little bit weird to some of you right like you know if we know that he's won the series right everything's already happened he either won the battle or he didn't right but uh you know when we're modeling probability questions you know we don't really care about any sort of temporal relations or anything like that or even causal ones right like uh you know we're just uh like it it's all just you know numerical right you can kind of think of it a bit like an inference right like you know you've got some uncertainty right like you know maybe you're told that he won the battle you want to or sorry you're told that he won the series you want to update your belief that you know maybe he won the the first battle maybe he didn't uh and maybe you're not entirely confident in it uh but you'd like to estimate you know how confident you should be uh that might be one way to think about it um so in a sense it's kind of like looking at a backwards probability that you know something in the past has happened given that we observed something in the future uh so you know in general you know they they won't always be the same like this like you can kind of relate the probability of B given a to the probability of a given B they won't always be equal okay let's see how to relate them it just so happens that in this case right these two things oh these two things have the same probability okay so that's really the core reason why they were equal but more generally we have the following okay this is called base rule okay uh you can kind of think of it is you know it's just the product rule in disguise right so the probability of B given a equals the probability Oops why don't I split this into two lines probability of a given B probability of [Music] B divided by probability of a okay so in the example we just saw these two are the same so they just cancel uh but more generally you want to multiply by the quotient okay and you can kind of think of this as the product rule in disguise right like if you just move this probability of a over to this side right uh now you're just Computing the probability of the intersection of A and B on both sides does that make sense but uh it can often be useful uh you know even though it's not really saying anything new it can often be useful to think about it in this way okay if you kind of want to reverse the direction of an inference uh you want to multiply by the quotient of the two event the two probabilities of the events that you care about okay uh and one particularly useful uh consequence of this is the following so suppose we have two events B and C and we're kind of trying to condition them both on the same event okay so what is the probability of C given a no B given a divided by the probability of C given a okay and in particular often we would take C to be the complement of b or something like that and that will then help us to compute this probability of being given a okay so as it turns out this is going to be the probability of a given B times the probability of B divided by probability of a given C oops probability of C so does that make sense to everybody and the reason that this might you know this in particular might be useful uh in order to compute the probability of B you know if we uh use B complement to C right this right hand side here does not depend on the probability of a right like we don't have to compute the probability of a so maybe if a is some really nasty event right and we don't actually want to compute its probability but we can still condition on it we might still be able to use this formula more easily than we could use this one okay does that make sense to everybody okay so let's take a look at a couple of applications of BAS R uh or actually first first maybe I should uh give you a brief lesson in statistics uh so terminology the probability of uh a given B uh this would often be called the likelihood of a given B okay so if any of you have ever seen like maximum likelihood estimations or anything like that that's where this comes from or this is where that comes from sorry uh probability of B we call the prior probability of B and the left hand side the probability of being given an a is the posterior of B uh actually we don't usually specify a with that oops okay so this is how you would normally talk about it like in statistics or something like that uh the the likelihood of a given B the prior probability and the posterior probability because basically what you're doing right is you're starting with some prior right if you don't know anything like this is kind of what you think the the probability of B should be and now you make some uh some observation a right and so now you update and you got a posterior probability of B you know condition on that that uh uh observation does that make sense okay so why don't we take a look at a couple of examples then uh here hopefully everybody is okay with those okay so first example suppose I've got two coins okay uh I've got one Fair coin right I toss this coin and it'll come up heads with 50% probability tails with 50% probability okay and I've also got a trick coin right it's uh you know double heads I flip it I always get heads okay uh suppose I pick one of these coins uniformly at random I flip that coin and it comes up heads okay what is the probability that I picked the far coin to begin with as opposed to the biased one any ideas does anybody have any guesses as to what the probability is who wants to just dra draw the tree diagram few people people aren't as enthusiastic about it as as they were on Tuesday that's uh that's slightly unfortunate let's do it anyway uh no let's let's first uh you know let's make precise the events that we care about okay um so let's let H be the event uh that we flipped heads uh and uh f is the event picked the fa coin okay so what is the probability that we're trying to compute in terms of these two quantities yeah probability of f given H yes okay so how might we compute this people didn't seem too enthusiastic about the tree diagram so what else could we do instead does anybody see a way to use base rule yeah or just a stretch sorry yeah yeah the probability of H given f is easy right that's that's 50% okay so that's that's an easy known quantity so if we use base rule right that that might make it easier to uh to compute okay so uh actually why don't we use the uh you know slightly more complicated version of Base rule so let's compute the ratio of the probability that we picked the faircoin given that we observed a heads versus you know the the probability of the of picking the biased coin given that we observed a heads okay so the probability of f given H over probability of not F given H so what was that so right base rule is about you know flipping the uh flipping the order right so instead of f conditioned on H we want H conditioned on F multiplied by what yeah yeah probability of f okay and on the bottom we can do the same thing probability of H given not F times the probability of not F okay so this expression is much easier to work with right what's the probability of H given f yep2 yeah okay what about the probability of H given not F yeah one and probability of F and not F those are each one half by assumption okay okay so those just cancel and we are left with2 okay so now what is this probability we computed the ratio of this probability to its complement right so what does that tell us the uh probability is yeah one3 yeah okay so OB serve here that uh if our prior changes right if the if the chance that we are you know picking the fa coin to begin with changes uh this posterior probability also changes okay so you know if if I if I originally picked the Fair coin with very high probability right uh and then I observe a heads right do you think the uh probability that a the the posterior probability should be the same higher or lower oh yeah how did we get a third oh question how did we get a third uh so the ratio of this to its complement is 12 right they sum to one right so they're 1/3 and 2/3 okay yeah the numerical values of h and f uh so h and f are events they're not uh they're not numbers exactly right so you know H is the event that you know whichever coin I flipped uh I got a heads on it right and F is the event that the the coin I picked was the Fair one okay so they're not really numbers they're just you know sets of outcomes that could have happened okay yeah oh the assumptions right so um you know pick uh fair or biased uh uniformly and then uh flip it so fair means it comes up with 5050 you know heads or tails biased it's a two-headed coin okay yeah uh explain where the one/ third came from again okay so uh the probability of f given H over not F given h right these are complimentary probabilities they should sum to one okay so we figured that the ratio right is uh2 okay so you know if we want them to to sum to one then then they should be 1/3 and 2/3 okay does does that make sense yeah okay yeah sorry oh question if it's biased do we care in which direction it's biased uh yes absolutely so if it's you know a double tailed coin instead of a double heads coin right you know if I observe a heads it must be the Fair coin right because the the double Tales coin cannot get a heads right so then my probability is just one okay are people reasonably happy with this example shall we move on to a second one okay second example Co testing woohoo everybody loves Co testing right oh I suppose you most of you probably weren't here when there were those like you know daily or near daily nasal swabs right well those those were fun times okay um so in the next next couple of examples we're going to see some you know rather counterintuitive behavior that uh arises from base rule okay so you know you just as we were discussing last time you kind of want to throw away uh intuitive reasoning and you know just go with the numbers okay so suppose 10% of MIT has Co okay uh and everybody has to take a covid test okay uh they have a false positive rate uh uh of uh 30% and false negative rate of 10% okay so false positive rate means you know uh if I'm am healthy and I take a covid test there's a 30% chance that it's going to be wrong and it's going to say that I'm I have Co okay okay so it's it's falsely reporting a positive positive result uh and false negative is the opposite so if I'm sick and I take a covid test there is a 10% chance that it does not detect it and it reports that I'm healthy okay do does the setup make sense yeah oh uh question was are the false positives included in the 10% or is the 10% when you actually have it uh so this 10% is you know conditioned on being sick okay the conditional probability that it gets it wrong is 10% and the false positive rate is conditioned on being oh sorry false negative is conditioned on being healthy false positive is conditioned on being sick no no positive positive is sick yeah it was right the first time sorry I'm I'm confused uh yeah so these are both talking about conditional probabilities okay conditioned on being healthy or sick what's the probability that the test is accurate or wrong okay so let's define some events let's say that H is you know healthy uh and S can be its complement sick uh plus is going to be positive result and minus is going to be a negative result okay so suppose I take this covid test and it comes out positive okay what's the probability that I have covid so first what is the probability that we're trying to compute yeah probability of s unconditionally yeah so s given positive right the unconditional probability of s is just 10% by assumption okay what we're actually looking for is the probability of uh probability that I'm sick given that I tested positive okay because that's the observation that we made okay so how would we compute this well let's do the same thing we just did over here let's look at the ratio of this probability to its complement okay and and applies apply base rule so we're going to flip this uh conditional here positive given sick times probability of sick divided by probability of positive given healthy times probability of healthy okay now those four probabilities are probab that we know okay what are they what's the probability of plus given that I'm sick yeah yeah 90% so let's write that as 0. n what's the uh prior probability that I'm sick yeah 10 10% and now what's the probability of a positive result condition on being healthy yeah yeah that's the false positive rate3 times and what's the probability that I'm healthy the prior probility of I'm healthy well that's just going to be the complement of the uh the event that I'm sick so that's going to be. n okay so these NS cancel this is going to be 1/3 okay so I am 1/3 as likely to be sick as healthy so the probability that I'm sick condition on getting the positive result is actually only one and four okay so probability s given plus equals 1/4 does that make sense to everybody so it might seem a little bit weird right like uh uh you know this this test is a pretty good one right like it's usually giving the right answer but you know I took the test I got a positive result but I'm still probably healthy why is that can anybody explain what's going on here yeah yeah exactly so that there's a very slim chance that I'd Co to begin with so it's actually much higher now that I've got a positive result but the uh the the prior was kind of overwhelmingly in favor of being healthy and so it's still you know very likely that I'm healthy just you know slightly less so okay so often people kind of underestimate the uh uh the impact of the prior in this way okay uh of course in the real world you generally don't uh do this so if you get a positive result uh you can be more confident in it because you know normally you only test when you have symptoms right so the probability that you uh uh that you're sick given that you tested positive and you have symptoms that's probably going to be much higher than 1/4 okay are people happy with that yeah okay why don't we look at another interesting application called Simpsons paradox okay so there's actually kind of a funny story behind this one uh so about 50 years ago uh Berkeley UC Berkeley got sued right because uh you know that it was claimed that they were being very sexist in their admissions policies um and uh you know the claim was that the admissions rate was much higher for men than it was for women right so you know that's that's clearly bad right but then Berkeley counter claimed by saying that if you look at each individual Department it's actually the opposite like women are being admitted uh with much higher rates than men right so um what's going on was somebody lying can these both be true any ideas yeah yeah exactly so the uh the the observation right was that the sizes of the Departments could be very different right and what else yeah yeah so the the the admissions rates like the the the overall admissions rates for the Departments can also be very different right and so you know maybe you know there's some departments like you know let's let's take a look at a very simple example okay so suppose we have two departments e and CS okay right uh and you know maybe both of them mildly favor women okay but uh uh you know one of them is much more popular with men one of them is much more popular with women and they have very different admissions rates you know generally okay so maybe uh we have a 100 men and 100 women applying to you know this two Department UC Berkeley okay and uh maybe we have 99 uh women and one man apply to Cs and in we it's the opposite one woman and men okay and maybe uh in CS we're a bunch of snobs right we we hate everybody we take one applicant okay so maybe we take you know one woman is accepted everybody else is rejected okay uh and dou on the other hand has no standards at all they'll just take anybody with a pulse uh but unfortunately one of these men is dead so uh you know they take one woman and men okay so now if you look at the individual Department's admissions rates right uh CS has accepted a woman right so their their admissions rate for women is you know nonzero they haven't accepted any men so they've got a zero admissions rate for men so it's higher for women right and in E they've accepted all of the women but not all of the men so again it's higher for women but if you look at what's happened overall right we've got two women being accepted and 98 men right so you can kind of argue that you know rather than being a problem with the university uh or or the Departments it's kind of more of a systemic problem like uh you know maybe they're you know encouraging men and women to apply to uh different departments at different rates and uh you know it's all a bit messy and uh you know also this is 50 years ago so you know they only really considered men and women women didn't really you know consider anybody who you know identified as anything else but you know we're not saying anything about that this is just kind of uh to illustrate the math so hopefully it's not terribly offensive but yeah uh even though for each department the the women are doing better than men the men are doing much better overall okay so that's what we call simp Simpsons Paradox does anybody have any question questions about that okay so last example has anybody seen the dragon prins couple of hands okay well so last example uh suppose a cake has gone missing from the bakery and and uh you know barus the baker has has a prime suspect right he thinks that Prince ezin stole the cake uh and you know he wants to present evidence to the king he would like to tell the king that you know this this uh this deviant is always stealing jelly Tarts from my bakery you know that makes it much more likely that he stole the cake right like jelly tart thieves are you know 10 times as likely as randos to to steal cakes okay it seems Seems fairly reasonable right does does anybody think that this is a good reason to uh admit the jelly tart thevery into uh into evidence who thinks that it's not a compelling reason well who has no idea morans okay so uh maybe Prince cen's counter claim is well if you look at you know all jelly tart thieves you know only one in say 2500 of them actually go on to Steel cakes so like you know even though the probability of you know being a cake thief has you know increased dramatically from from the the Baseline in terms of like a multiplicative Factor it can't actually have increased very much because you know it went from 1 125,000 to 1 12500 right so the uh the probative value here is you know essentially zero right you're you're trying to prove guilt Beyond A Reasonable Doubt right and so a 1 in 2500 chance increase is kind of negligible but on the other hand you know if you admit this into evidence the king is going to be biased against ezren right he's going to be like oh this kid's a thief this is terrible we got to punish him right regardless of whether he stole the cake so uh so who's right is is the baker right or is the uh is the suspect right who thinks Baker is right who think suspect is right who thinks [Laughter] neither yeah I've got a few HS okay so um well both parties here are trying to reason about uh a conditional probability okay what is that conditional probability anybody well maybe we should start by writing out some events so let's let J be the event suspect [Music] steals jelly tarts uh C can be the event suspect steals cake and X can be the event cake was stolen okay so both the Baker and the suspect we making claims about conditional probabilities what specific conditional probability in terms of these events were they making claims about yeah sorry uh repeat the assertions oh the assumptions uh so the assumptions were right that a cake has gone missing from the bakery the baker has a prime suspect okay and the the Baker wants to admit into evidence that this suspect is always stealing jelly Tarts okay and the reasoning is that uh you know jelly tart thieves are much more likely to steal cakes than you know random other people okay and the suspect counters by saying well sure but like only one in 2500 jelly tart thieves is actually a cake thief right so you know the actual increase is less than 1 in okay so what are the probabilities that they're reasoning about what are the conditional probabilities yeah yeah well you're both right sorry it's um geometry they're both trying to reason about probability of C given J right you know so we're conditioning on the suspect having stolen jelly Tarts and they're both trying to make claims about you know what is the probability of C conditioned on that okay so well the baker is arguing that probability of C given J divided by probability of C given not J is high right so you know because this is you know about 10 J is very relevant to the case so it should be admitted okay uh the suspect is saying that probability of C given J is low right so J cannot actually uh dramatically increase the probability right the increase is going to be less than this probability yeah yeah so that's a good point um so the the point was that we're we're talking about you know one individual suspect one individual cake one individual case right so kind of as we were saying before when we first uh started looking at rule like you know either it happened or it didn't right like you could say that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to talk about probabilities right but you know you're trying to convince you know the king or a jury or somebody right um so this is kind of you know similar to when you present DNA evidence in court or something like that uh like the fact that there's a match means that there's you know overwhelming probability that the uh the suspect was at the crime scene or something like that right so like you you do kind of still talk about probabilities uh but you could think of it as like you know how confident are you in the inference that uh that the suspect did something does that make sense okay okay so so if you were the judge in this case determining what should be presented to the king what would your verdict be do do we allow jelly tart thievery into evidence or no pardon draw a tree diagram draw a tree diagram uh well that's not actually necessary anymore we've already figured out what the uh probabilities are the uh question is um you know is the probative value good enough to justify you know putting it into evidence or is the probative value small enough that the uh bias is going to be more more of a factor yeah oh yeah so it it it will not you know generally capture the full story and this is why you know lawyers in a courtroom are you know trying to find all kinds of evidence to uh to bolster their cases so yeah like something like that might be something that the uh the defense would want to uh would want to present um or the prosecution might be like oh but even though it's an MIT student like it's an it eecs student who do steel cakes all the time so I'm getting some uh some nods That's mildly [Laughter] concerning so uh you know like yeah it's going to be very difficult to capture the entire picture um for right now we're just trying to limit the scope to like these are these are the things that are known right we we know that a cake is stolen we know that this suspect steals jelly Tarts uh but that's it like we we want to try and figure out you know what the the probative value of this evidence is uh just based on those does that make sense so who thinks who thinks the jelly tart should be admitted who thinks no okay I'm I'm I'm getting more hands this time less extensions okay does anybody want to say why yeah mhm yeah so the the observation rate was uh you know the probability of C given not J is also very low right and in fact it is much lower than than C given J um so that's kind of where this this uh the the ratio there probability of C given J over C given not J is coming from right like uh probability of C given J is 1 and 2500 probability of C given not J is 1 and 25,000 right so that's where you're getting this factor of 10 so you you agree with the uh the defense that this should not be ad admitted into evidence okay does anybody have any Contra claims yeah yeah yeah so that's a good point we've uh we've kind of forgotten about something right a cake was stolen right we don't care that the probability of cakes being stolen is low it it happened right so you know we we we don't really care about these probabilities at all what is the actual probability we care about what we really want is is probability of C given what yeah well not that they stole a cake but that a cake was stolen yeah so C given j and x okay so that's what we really care about right uh that the fact that the cake is stolen is really important right like if uh no if you don't know whether the cake is stolen right why are you even having a trial and as it turns out this probability is something like 80% jelly tart thieves founded bakeries with missing cakes usually they're the guilty party um so yeah I've kind of made this a little bit more palatable but uh this is uh you know based on an actual courtroom case um like this this is the kind of thing that that people uh you know like people try and use and you know end up misusing probabilities and conditional probabilities all the time this was actually from a very high-profile case the OJ Simpson case um where both the defense and the prosecution attorneys like you know they're supposed to be experts uh but you know they were both making bogus claims about uh about conditional probabilities uh you know it's it's very easy to make these kinds of mistakes so you know fall back on fundamentals uh when you're an adult fall back on the fundamentals even if you're not it's probably a good idea anyway okay uh feel free to come up if you have any questions and uh otherwise we will see you next week
