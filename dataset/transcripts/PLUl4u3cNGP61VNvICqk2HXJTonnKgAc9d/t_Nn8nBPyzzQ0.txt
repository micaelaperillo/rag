okay uh can people hear me in the back we good okay nice let's uh let's get started so uh last week uh last week yes last week uh we started talking about uh our number Theory unit and in particular Vis visibility uh and we saw a very exciting uh you know application of of divisibility saving New York City uh today we're going to look at an even more exciting example um modular arithmetic uh so recall so uh we saw bit's identity and uh the pulverizer so I'll just write that up here so for all integers uh a B uh there exists s and t whoops such that uh that's a little bit confusing sorry uh gcd of a comma b equals a s + b t okay and uh moreover we can compute these uh efficiently using the uh the pulverizer the extended ukan algorithm uh then the other useful fact that we're going to make use of today uh every number uh can be written as an ilc of A and B if and only if it is divisible by their gcd okay so we are going to make use of these two facts so do not forget okay oh sorry okay so let's start talking about modular arithmetic then um I expect that at least in some form it is something that's you know fairly familiar to all of you uh so presumably you learned back in grade school like what what is the sum of an even integer and an odd integer what what do you know about it did people not learn this oh yeah yeah it's odd okay so first example even plus odd is odd even plus odd is odd okay uh what is the last digit of uh say 357 by 994 yeah eight yeah so ends in eight okay why is that yeah you can you can basically ignore everything except the uh the last two digits uh you multiply those together you get 28 that ends in an eight so this is also going to end in an eight okay uh it's currently 2:39 p.m. what time will it be in 49 hours 330 yeah about 339 in 49 hours and why is that yeah uh is that an answer how how are we getting to that yeah yeah so 49 hours is one hour more than two full days we can kind of forget about those two days and just add an hour onto the current time okay uh what day of the week will it be 100 days from now Thursday yeah 100 days is uh two days more than uh 14 weeks right so we can forget about those 14 weeks add those two days and we get Thursday okay so these are all you know fairly familiar examples to to most of you hopefully of uh modular arithmetic and the the theme is kind of that when you're when you're working modulo n uh you're just ignoring all multiples of N and only focusing on remainders okay so even and odd this is the remainder when dividing by two days of the week we divide by seven look at the remainder uh last digit this is you know remainder when we divide by 10 uh our remainder when we divide by 12 or 24 depending on whether you care about AM or PM uh and so we often call Modular arithmetic clock arithmetic for for this reason uh because it's something that people are are familiar within that context okay so let's define what we mean actually why don't we use a new board for this so we're going to say that a is congruent n to B so this can be uh that this will usually be pronounced uh a is congruent to b modulo n uh if and only if uh n divides a minus B okay so you might also see this written as uh a congruent to B mod n who has seen this notation before okay many who has seen this notation uh couple not quite as many okay so uh for the purposes of this class um we're going to you know generally be using this notation we're going to try not to use the the right one right yes right um and I will explain why in in a few minutes uh the the right one even for people who think they're familiar it uh often leads to some uh some confusion okay so let's let's try and stick with this one until you like really know what you're doing okay but uh you know for future reference if you see the the right one it means the same thing okay so basically we would like to consider a and b to be you know the same like you can think of this roughly speaking as equals uh if n divides their difference okay so for example if we're working modulo 5 there are only you know five different kind of distinct values okay so we're going to notate them like this so uh that this is uh the congruence class of of Z modu of 5 so everything that's congruent to to zero okay so this is going to be 0 plus orus 5 plus or minus 10 Etc okay so that's you know one set of of values that are the same got a second one represented by one okay and this is going to be you know 1 6 11 uh - 4 - 9 okay so everything that's equivalent to one modu 5 and then we've got three more okay defined analogously okay and so for a general K which of these five groups is it going to belong to like how how would we figure it out yeah yeah so uh the answer was we're going to divide it by the the modulus five and look at the remainder okay [Music] so a general K is going to be an element of the remainder when we divide K by five okay does that make sense to everybody okay so in particular if we write uh you know K = 5 q + r where R is between zero and five then K is going to be an element of this set okay so that makes sense to everybody Rec simply happy with this okay so more generally recall the division theorem okay so the division theorem says uh for all pairs um n comma D with d greater than zero there exists a unique pair of integers uh q and R with uh zero less than or equal to R less than d uh such that uh n equals QD + r okay uh and we say that Q here is the quotient and we sometimes denote this as uh div n comma D or sometimes we might write this in infix notation and div D okay and R is the remainder so this is going to be uh REM n comma D or sometimes we also write this as n REM D okay [Music] yeah sorry oh uh the exclamation after the exists this means there exists a unique pair uh so not only does there exist some pair but there's only one of them okay so when working modulo n uh a number is always going to be equivalent to its remainder sometimes we'll also call this its its residue okay and you know just as we saw up here uh these residue classes uh form a partition of all of the uh of all of the integers okay so oh sorry so the the numbers zero up through n minus one uh these represent you know all of the possible groupings uh modulo n okay does that make sense to everybody okay so the following theorem is quite useful so A and B are congruent modulo n if and only if remainder of a comma n is equal to the remainder when you divide B by n okay so how might we prove this rigorously any ideas somebody volunteers yeah okay yeah so we're we're going to use the division theorem right the if if we apply the division theorem to to both A and B we're going to get the same R okay I'm going to back up a step first uh at a very high level what do we need to do in order to prove a statement like this we're trying to prove an if and only if we have to prove implications in both directions okay so first direction if uh REM a comma n equals REM B comma n then uh a is congruent mod n to B okay so we're going to assume that these are equal right so then the the r that we get from the division theorem is the same in both cases so a = q n + r b = q Prime n + r okay now what happens when we subtract them well then we get a minus b = n * Q - Q prime plus r - R and this is zero okay so now the difference is a multiple of n so by our definition A and A and B are congruent okay does that make sense to everybody yeah uh oh so some examples of a n and B okay uh so for example uh 17 is congruent mod 5 to 12 okay because five divides the difference right if you subtract them you get five uh five is a multiple of five so they're congruent okay uh 17 is also congruent to say 32 right if you subtract these you get5 same deal it's not congruent to 33 okay if you subtract those you get -6 which is not a multiple of of five okay any other questions yeah okay so well this is only half the proof right we're we're proving One Direction so we are assuming that uh the two remainders are the same okay and we're trying to prove this right so if the two remainders are the same right that's you know from the division theorem we've got the same R in both cases so uh we're going to write them we're going to write both numbers in that form okay so a is qn plus r r b is QPR n plus r Prime but you know we established that R is equal to R Prime okay so we're just writing that as Q Prime n uh plus r okay and now in order to show that A and B are equivalent we have to subtract and and see whether the difference is a multiple of n so in this case when we subtract them right the RS cancel uh the N factors out and we get uh n * Q - Q Prime okay so that is indeed a multiple of N and so uh you know n divides the difference so they're equivalent congruent okay yeah uh how we say this a is congruent to B mod n or a is congruent mod n to B uh there are you know several different ways of of saying it okay okay what about going in the other direction suppose a is congruent mod n to B now we want to prove that the remainders uh when you divide by n are the same how do we do that y okay okay okay yeah so the the last step here is now to use the division theorem again okay so if we apply the division theorem I guess to B is probably going to be the most useful right we can write b equals let's do the same form that we had there Q Prime n + r okay now a is B plus k n so that's going to be Q prime plus K * n plus r okay and now the division theorem says that this Q prime plus K and R those are unique okay so that Q prime plus K is the the Q that we need and the the r is the same okay so both of them have the same remainder okay do does this make sense to everybody yeah uh a congruent to B mod n uh so what we're trying to prove an if and only if here right so for One Direction we're assuming one side and trying to prove the other and for the other direction like we did the opposite right so this is One Direction we're assuming that the remainders are the same and we want to prove that they're equivalent they're congruent for the other direction we assume that they're congruent and then we want to prove that the remainders are the same okay so kind of two separate proofs any other questions okay so yeah in in some sense we can consider you know the the N different numbers like 0 through n minus one to be you know the only numbers we care about when when working mod n okay everything else is going to be equivalent to one of those it's going to be equivalent to its remainder okay uh so I'm going to take a moment here to talk about notation okay uh so the remainder which we've called uh REM a comma n uh so our convention right is that uh you know even if n is negative this remainder should always be positive okay not everybody uses this convention uh so particular in in particular when you're dealing with uh programming languages um most have you know some operation that looks like this uh it may be denoted uh differently in different languages um like sometimes it's a percent sign sometimes it's actually you know rem or mod or something like that and uh sometimes it'll behave the same as as you know how we def it sometimes it'll be allowed to be negative so like if n is negative the remainder might be negative or something like that okay and uh some languages have both uh usually with different names like uh you know mod versus double mod uh in this class whenever we write uh RAM m a comma n we always mean the the positive uh or the the non- negative remainder so this is always going to be you know between zero and uh n okay um and perhaps even more confusing uh sometimes this would be written as mod of a comma n or even worse an infix not a uh a mod n okay so this is why we don't like to use uh the word mod when talking about modular uh congruences um because if you see something like uh say AAL B mod n what does that mean who can tell me what that means MH yeah do do do you have a uh a guess okay and what why is that yeah the answer was that's just the definition um yeah so the the the important distinction here is between these two things right right these are very different statements okay the mod here is kind of attached to this uh equivalence uh sign and uh so this is you know talking about a relation between A and B okay this is a function written in infix notation okay so that this is saying that you know a is actually equal to the one value uh that you get when you you know divide B by n and take the remainder okay so these mean different things it is going to be much less confusing if you use uh you know a equals B REM n or you know in prefix notation REM B comma n uh for the left one and a congruent mod n to B for the right one okay so it's hopefully much more obvious what the distinction is between you know these two things than between these two things so please use the ones on the bottom until you are you know very comfortable with with modular arithmetic okay okay so let's go uh let's go back to the actual content now so as I promised before we're actually going to be talking about arithmetic so let's let's start on that okay so the the simple statement that we wrote up there on the on the left even plus odd equals uh equals odd in some sense that's saying something kind of profound right like you know no matter which uh even number and which odd number you pick if you add them together you're always going to get an odd number okay uh and you know more generally if we take you know any a congruent to let's say 3 mod 5 and any B congruent mod 5 to say four right if you add them what do you know about it what do you know about their sum yeah mhm so their sum is always going to be congruent to two module of five okay or perhaps uh an easier thing to see is it's always going to be equivalent to s which is in turn you know congruent to two Okay so adding A and B module of 5 like you you get the same result as if you you know add these two equivalent remainders okay so we have a theorem suppose that uh A and B are equivalent mod n then for all C we have the following uh I have space here so a + C is congruent to B+ C uh a minus C is congruent to B minus C uh C minus a is congruent to C minus b and a * C is congruent to B * C okay so as you might expect you know if you want to add subtract or or multiply modulo n you're kind of allowed to replace things wherever you want with uh something it's equivalent to okay so at any point during this computation you can you know replace uh oh sorry different A and B uh that this this is not relevant for the theorem statement like if if a and b are equivalent then you can you know replace A's with B's wherever you want and you'll get the same result okay do does that make sense uh okay so question what about a to the C and B to the C so let's assume that uh you know C is positive for now can I say anything about exponentiation modu n okay if we assume that uh A and B are congruent modu n can we say anything about a to the C versus B to the c yeah yeah so uh let let me rephrase that slightly I you can prove it more formally by induction okay right so you can repeatedly multiply every multiplication is going to give you you know congruent values okay so by the time you get to to a power of C there's still going to be congruent okay so yes this is true and proof by induction on C okay so our base case is going to be when C equals 1 okay in this case you know our assumption is that a is congruent to B right so a to the 1 is congruent to a well it's equal to a b to the 1 is equal to B so this is fine uh our inductive step so assume that a to the cus one is congruent mod n to B to the cus1 okay now what happens when we uh when we increment our exponent what is a to the C yeah mhm okay so we can uh you know strip off a a a factor of a now we can replace each of these factors individually okay so by our theorem up there this is congruent to B the cus one * a okay we can replace this factor and now by our uh theorem assumption right we can replace this Factor as well okay does that make sense to everybody okay what about C to the A and C to the B so we just saw that when we're working modu n we're allowed to you know replace uh the base of exponents as we like can we do the same thing with the with the uh exponents themselves show pounds for yes show pounds for no okay no it seems like it's winning out by popular vote but not by much there are a lot of extensions uh can anybody give me a reason why or why not yeah uh 2^2 is not congruent mod 5 to what 2 cubed uh okay that is a true statement um does that uh does that yeah so you you are correct that we only need one counter example um is this a counter example so let's see so the the the claim right is that if a is congruent to B mod n then C to the a is congruent to C to the B right we haven't satisfied our precondition here two is not congruent to three Mod Five okay so you you are you have the uh the right idea we do want to find a single counter example that will suffice to disprove this uh we're going to need a different counter example if we want this to work okay does anybody else have an idea for a counter example or failing that does any have a proof yeah okay uh what are the smaller components like factors of of C yeah okay uh so what do you want to do with those factors of C I suppose we could you know strip off you know say a is smaller than b we could strip off a of them okay so you want to divide out a bunch of factors of uh C and until we get something like this okay um how do you divide modern okay let's look at a concrete example so let's uh keep trying to to look at five let's say B minus a is also five is this a true statement sorry did did somebody um is this true for all C so I I claim that minus one is not going to work here right yeah yeah so anything to the zeroth power is is one that's that's fine uh the the problem is uh you know we're subtracting a from both of these exponents right so if say you have b equal 5 plus a right you're going to end up with five on on the the right hand side right so counter example right is going to be you know maybe we could have something like you know C to the one and C to the 6 and in particular we're going to want C to be minus one okay uh n was five that's right okay so this is our counter example right we've exhibited a specific a B and N where our you know uh purported theorem statement fails okay it is not the case that minus 1 1 is congruent mod 5 to min-1 6 right the left hand side isus one the right right hand side is positive one okay so when exponentiating we have to be careful we are allowed to replace the bases of exponents we're not allowed to replace the exponents themselves okay so we will see in a little while how we can uh you know get around this to some degree we can do something with the exponents it's just not this okay uh why don't we take a look at an example first so suppose X is 1 1335 to the 11111 uh multiplied by 6 + 7799 to the 5 okay uh how might we compute remainder of X after we divide by 100 okay how can we use the uh two theorems that we did prove to compute that efficiently what might our first step be uh okay so the answer was distribute this uh across this addition um I claim that that's going to make our lives harder not easier so what what was the theme of the two theorems that we just proved if we want to do computations modul n we can replace things by you know other numbers that are easier to work with uh and which are congruent okay so Computing the remainder when we divide by 100 right that's looking for a computation modul 100 okay so we can replace these values modul 100 and make them easier to work with Okay are any of these values that I've written down uh congruent to anything nice modu 100 anyone yeah yeah yeah so we can just get rid of these right that's congruent to 35 what else can we do yeah uh so we're we're Computing modul 100 right we're looking for the remainder when we divide by 100 uh so we know that uh one whoops 1335 is congruent to 35 modul okay yeah so we're we're getting rid of the the first three digits and only looking at the remainder after we divide by 100 okay so basically the the idea is that we can do this division you know at intermediate steps we we can you know take remainders uh in the middle of our computation okay that's that's what these two theorems are are telling us okay anything else that we can simplify no does somebody want to do that computation by hand no nobody yeah okay okay okay okay yeah we can do the same thing here turn that into just um I claim that we can take that a step further 99 is not particularly easy to work with I claim that there's something else it's equivalent to that is yeah uh not zero negative one yeah so we can replace the 7799 with negative Okay negative 1 is easy to work with Okay so now what happens yeah yeah okay so let's exponentiate this negative 1 so we end up with 6 + 1 which is 7 now what do we do about 35 to the uh 11,111 uh we don't really know how to do anything with with exponents right so let's kind of just try to start exponentiating it and see what happens okay so what's 35 squ that's going to be uh well if we actually compute it it'll be 1225 right I think is that right 1175 1225 okay so that's going to be congruent to okay 35 cubed well it's going to be 25 * 35 okay so that's 875 so that's that's going to be congruent to 75 okay 35 to 4th uh 35 to 4th is going to be 35 squar squared again so 25 squ okay 25 squ is 625 that also has a remainder of 25 so what's going to happen after this point what happens is we continue multiplying by 35 yeah the answer was it'll alternate between 75 and 25 right whenever we have an odd power as long as it's greater than one right uh when we exponentiate uh 35 it's going to be 75 whenever we have an even power it's going to be 25 okay you can you know prove that formally by induction not going to do that here but the point is 35 we've got an odd exponent here so we can replace this with okay and now 75 * 7 is going to have a remainder of 25 okay okay so does that make sense to everybody we perform the computation but instead of just like doing it over the integers and then reducing mod 100 right we're reducing mod 100 you know whenever we can we're we're always trying to replace intermediate values with things that are easier to work with okay and that simplifies our computation considerably yeah uh you can perform the computation uh 25 by 21 is possibly an easier one to do okay okay uh any other questions yeah yes uh so uh we had six plus -1 to the 5K okay uh so we are you know exponentiating this this negative 1 over the integers right negative 1 to uh any even power is going to be one okay so we sorry oh sorry uh 5K 5,000 sorry it's it's not actually um yeah my bad this this kind of K okay sorry that's that's that's my bad any other questions yeah pardon like oh okay so the the question was is there always going to be a pattern like this uh so this is kind of touching on um stuff that we will see later but yes there will always be some pattern it may not be this easy to find right but you know the basic idea right is that there are only 100 different values that it that it could take you know modul 100 right so if you have you know more than 100 Powers right something's going to have to collide okay and you know at that point it'll start repeating uh here it you know it it happened to be quite nice it started repeating you know very quickly in the the period is only two uh that may not always be the case though okay but we we will see in a moment how to uh uh you know something more about uh about what we can say about that okay okay so we we've seen how to add subtract multiply how to change the bases of exponents what about division okay are we allowed to divide modulo n so suppose we have 3x is congruent uh to 3 modul 6 okay so if we had this over the integers say or over the reals right uh I guess reals are a better example if we just had you know 3x = 3 how would we solve this for X it's it's not a trick question I promise yeah yeah you just divide both sides by three right you you can cancel off this three and you just just get xal 1 okay so now the actual question is can we do that you know modu n can we do that modu of 6 are we allowed to just cancel these threes and conclude that uh oops X is congruent to one modul yeah okay uh so the answer is yes because it's the same as multiplying by 1/3 okay uh so remember that 1/3 is not really uh something that we can like it it doesn't really make sense modulo modul n okay or at least not modul 6 you know sometimes it might make sense sometimes it might not we'll see more about that in a moment um but like what is a third right we're talking about integers yeah so sorry so other way around multiply instead of dividing okay uh so the suggestion was instead of dividing by three let's try multiplying by something so that we get one here okay so let's you know try to multiply this like you know multiply both sides by some a and this should end up being one if we choose our a appropriately okay what a do we choose does there exist such an a yeah yeah okay so the original claim is false uh the counter example right is that we could take X's three here right 3 * 3 is is 9 that is congruent to three right but X is not congruent to one okay so the answer I guess to the to the follow-up question is that no there is there's no such a right we cannot divide by three or you know multiply by something to to uh get one okay and this is you know basically the same thing that we were doing last week right we're looking for a solution to you know 3 a is congruent to 1 modul 6 right if we unpack what this uh actually means 6 divides 3 a - okay is there a solution to this no okay so basically that's asking if we can uh write one as a linear combination of six and three okay but one is not a multiple of their gcd so we cannot okay does that make sense to everybody so we cannot always divide are there circumstances under which we can divide yeah uh oh okay so the idea was divide to divide the six as well um yeah I suppose he could do that um but we are looking you know we are specifically trying to do arithmetic modul 6 so that may or may not make sense right um but I mean yeah I suppose you could say you know six divides uh 3x - 3 a and so you could you know factor out a three and say that you know X is at least all and in fact that that does characterize the solutions to the uh to the original problem it's just that may or may not you know that may or may not be what you're actually looking for okay okay so under what circumstances are we allowed to divide so you know we just saw that we can't divide here because you know there's no uh solution to this equation okay what if there is a solution like what if instead of uh modulo 6 we had uh modulo okay would we be allowed to divide here if we have 3 X's congruent to 3 modul 5 can we then include x is congruent to one module of 5 seeing some nods why well basically exactly the same reason right this exactly characterizes when what we described will work okay if uh the the modulus and the uh Co efficient we're trying to divide by our co-prime right if their G gcd is one then we'll be able to divide okay uh so more formally let's write out what we mean so let's start with a definition so we'll say that uh a multiplicative inverse of let's call it x uh modulo n uh which we will denote uh x to the ne 1 is a number uh which as you might expect satisfies the following uh congruence okay so just as we have multiplicative inverses over the reals right so x * X inverse should be equal to one in that case we are defining something analogous uh when we're working mod n okay so does that definition make sense to people so as an example right uh one inverse uh you know so one is a is a multiplicative inverse of one maybe I should write it like that you know anything okay two is a multiplicative inverse of three Mod Five okay because 2 * 3 is six six is congruent to one modul 5 okay so two and three are modul inverse modular inverses of each other modu of five the the last part yeah so um what this is saying right is that uh 2 * 3 is congruent to one modulo whoops I should write it like this okay uh so 2 * three is is six right six is congruent to one module of 5 right so that means that two and three are multiplicative inverses of each other module of five okay because when you multiply them you get one okay does that make sense okay so when do multiplicative inverses exist can anybody uh finish this theorem statement can anybody characterize this when is a invertible modul n yeah yeah when the gcd of A and N is one okay and why is that okay yeah so that's uh that's good intuition if the gcd were not one like say the the gcd is two right so both A and N are even right multiplying a by anything is going to give you an even number right that's never going to be congruent to one modul another even number okay so more formally so a has an inverse mod n if and only if uh there exists a b so this is just the the definition such that a is congruent mod n to one okay now how do we characterize when this is true well let's unpack this definition here okay so this means that n divides their difference so Oops why don't I write this as AB minus one okay right so we're saying that n divides a minus one we're looking at what that uh division actually looks like what the uh what the factor of n is okay so there's some Q such that qn is a minus one okay now we can rewrite this so 1 equal a minus q n okay so we're saying there exist B and Q such that 1 equal AB uh plus minus Q * n okay so this is just saying that one is an ilc of a Ann okay okay and as we saw before this happens if and only if the gcd is one okay so does that make sense to everybody so if two numbers have a gcd of one then we can divide by uh by one when working module of the other okay uh so if we have say 7x is congruent mod 30 to okay then we are allowed to divide by both sides because the gcd of 7 and 30 is one so we're allowed to divide both sides by seven okay so we are allowed to conclude that X is congruent mod 30 to two Okay I suppose more formally we'd want to find a multiplicative inverse of seven okay uh and I think 13 is such an inverse 7 by 13 91 yeah so if we multiply both sides by 13 right we'll get a coefficient of one over here and we'll get we'll get two uh on the right hand side okay so sometimes you can divide but not always okay so let's use that now to figure out what more we can say about exponentiation okay so the following is a theorem which is attributed to FMA as many things are it's often known as fma's little theorem not to be confused with fma's Last Theorem which FMA I I feel like that one should not be attributed to him at all um because he didn't prove it or I think he thought he knew a proof and was like a complete up but you know whatever uh f little theorem is a different story it is uh you know much more Elementary he did actually prove it um it states the following uh so if p is Prime and a is not a multiple of P so a not congruent mod P to zero okay then a to the P minus one is congruent mod P2 one okay [Music] so if you think about what this is saying a little bit right um it's similar to what we were trying to do with with exponents earlier but instead of getting rid of uh you know multiples of of p in an exponent when working working mod P we're instead going to get rid of multiples of P minus one okay so so basically we can always factor out an a to the P minus one without you know changing uh the end result yeah sorry thank you Zach I promise I'm awake yeah if if a is congruent to zero then um clearly this theorem is false uh yeah a a should not be congruent to zero if if a is congruent to zero then a to the pus one is also zero okay uh so how could we prove this any ideas it's a bit of a weird proof idea let's consider the following Set uh so a 2 a 3 a all the way up to P minus one * a okay now what can we say about this set if we reduce everything in it modu P MH yeah so the answer was that you know this is basically equivalent to this is abusing notation a bit okay the claim is that all of these are distinct modul p and none of them are zero okay why is that now first probably the easier part why is none of these zero that's basically saying why is none of them a multiple of P well all of the coefficients on a are less than P so P doesn't divide any of those P also doesn't divide a by assumption and P is prime so doesn't divide any of these products okay so none of these is zero why are they all dis in modul yeah okay um let me try and rephrase that uh so if you look at two different values right like two different coefficients you said so suppose for contradiction a * I equals a * J right so where we're actually going to use a instead of n okay or sorry this should be P okay what is this telling us yeah that's right yes yes so the answer was uh p is prime so A and P are co-prime right so a has an inverse we can consol it so this tells us that I is equivalent mod P to J right the two coefficients are equivalent the two coefficients are coming from the set 1 to P minus one so if they're congruent mod P they're actually equal okay so that means that all of these values are going to be distinct modul P none of them are zero so they're you know these particular values okay what happens when we multiply everything in s together well if we multiply everything in this set what do we get yeah yes uh P minus one factorial that's what it's called so if we take the product of both sides we have you know the product of this or sorry the product of this one is going to be equal to P minus one factorial okay what about the other one well the other one is going to be the same except we've got a bunch of factors of a right how many factors of a yeah yeah and so this will be a p minus1 * P minus1 factorial okay so P minus one factorial is equivalent to P minus1 factorial time a p minus one what does that tell us yeah okay so the answer was that because p is prime none of these numbers right are a multiple of P so their product is not a multiple of P so P minus one factorial is not a multiple of P so it has an inverse so that means that we can cancel it from both sides and we end up with one is congruent to a to the P minus one okay so we have uh P minus one factorial conent mod P pus1 factorial time a pus1 these canel and we have one is congruent to a to the P minus one okay and that's the uh result that we were looking for okay so if we're working mod n we cannot generally reduce exponents n but if n is prime we can instead reduce mod uh nus one okay do does that uh does that make sense to everybody so as an example so if we wanted to say find uh the remainder of seven to the say uh 95 uh modulo let's say 13 okay how might we do that well 13 is prime so instead of computing 7 to the 95 let's reduce that Mod 13 minus 1 so modul 12 okay so this is going to be the same as 7 to the what is it 11 13 okay now what can we do what is 7 to the 12 H sorry did did somebody give an answer I I no one yes okay so 7 12 is 1 right 7 11 * 7 is 7 to the 12 so this is the modular inverse of 7 modular 13 okay what can you multiply seven by to get one Mod 13 yeah two okay so that's all we have time for today um I will see you on Thursday and if you have any questions you know feel free to come up and ask
