Hello. Can people hear me? Hello? Getting some thumbs up. Okay, why don't we get started? Um, hello everybody. I'm Brenmore. Uh, if you've been coming to lecture, you've already met, uh, Eric and Zach. I'm the third instructor for this course. Uh, today we are going to switch gears a little bit. So, we're going to move on from uh, state machines and we're going to start a new unit on uh, algorithmic analysis. Uh so we'll be looking at that until the end of uh until the end of next week. Uh this lecture is going to be about sums. Okay. So sums are quite useful uh as I hinted out a moment ago. They're good for algorithmic analysis. You'll use uh you know everything in this unit uh quite a bit if you take uh 61210 or any other algorithms course. Uh they're also useful for things like you know probability uh counting uh machine learning everything's useful for machine learning nowadays uh recurrences and you know bunch of other things. Okay so let's start with uh let's start with an example. Okay has anybody here ever won the lottery? Hands. Nobody really Oh come on guys. Okay. Uh well does anybody know how it works? So, if you if you win a million dollars in the lottery, uh it it turns out you don't actually get a check for a million dollars in the mail. Or you do, but it won't it won't cash. Uh it actually comes in installments. Okay? So, imagine you get, you know, $50,000 now and, you know, $50,000 next year and so on for the next 20 years. Okay? So, you know, in total it ends up being a million dollars in some sense, right? Uh, but does it have the same value? Who would who would prefer to have a million dollars right now? Lots of hands. Who would prefer to have the uh the installments? 50,000 per year for 20 years. Oh, a few hands. Uh, can I get some reasons? Oh, you don't waste it all at once. Oh, that's an excellent reason. Suppose maybe anybody else. A reason either way. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. So, that's that's an argument for uh getting the million dollars right now, right? Uh the the $50,000 you get in 20 years, right? Like if uh if you know a gallon of milk costs, you know, four $4 today and like $10 in in 20 years, like that $50,000 isn't going to go so far, right? Uh so you know at least in terms of the actual you know buying power of the money you'd really prefer to have that $1 million right now. Uh cuz you know money now is more valuable than money in the future. Inflation or relatedly you can invest this money and it'll end up being more worth more in in uh in 20 years. Okay. So this is you know exactly how a loan works right? you uh you know you get a lump sum of money now and you pay it back in installments uh and you know you account for interest. Uh so this is what's known as an annuity. Okay. Uh so for an annuity we're going to make some you know fairly simplified assumptions. We're going to assume a fixed interest rate uh let's call it P. Okay. So as an example the uh Federal Reserve says that uh you know interest rate right now is about 5.33%. So let's just take that as a working example or at least that's what it was at the beginning of the week. I haven't checked it today. Uh, okay. And we're going to get m dollars every year for n years. Okay. So, in the example that we were just looking at, uh, m is 50k, n is 20 years, and you know, we've got this interest rate p 5.33%. Okay, so what does this mean about the value of money over time? Well, $1 now. If we get this $1 now, you know, it's going to be worth or it's, you know, equivalent to getting 1 plus P dollar one year from now. Does that make sense to everybody? Right? Like if I take my my $1 now and I invest it, I'll end up with like $15 uh in a year. Okay? Or in two years it'll be 1 plus p^ squ or you know in k years it'll be 1 plus p to the k. Okay. Uh conversely what if I get that dollar in you know 10 years how much is that worth in today's money? Anybody hunt? No. Are we still asleep too early in the morning? Okay. Well, you know, conversely, if uh uh if I get my dollar in 10 years, it's going to be worth 1 / 1 plus b to the 10th. Okay. Does that make sense to everybody? Yes. No. Kind of. Thumbs up. Few thumbs up. Okay. Good. Good. I'll I'll take it. Okay. So, basically what's going on is we're getting M dollars now M dollars in one year M dollars in two years. Okay. Dot dot dot up to n years. And we'd like to kind of figure out what the equivalent value is today. Okay. So this M dollars now you know this is worth M dollars today. Okay. Uh this M dollars in one year is going to be worth uh oops m * 1 + pus 1. Okay. This ms in two years is going to be m * 1 + p the minus 2 etc. And the ms that we get in n years is going to be m * 1 + p to the minus n. I guess this is uh n minus one, right? Yeah, we're starting at zero years. Okay, does that make sense to everybody? So, what is the total value the total equivalent value in in today's money? Okay, we we'd like this in a closed form. Okay, so right now we've kind of got we're trying to sum all of this up, right? But it's not a very nice expression. Okay. We we'd like a closed form. Something that you can, you know, put into one of those oldfashioned calculators if you've ever seen it. You know, those things that you hold in your hand and push the buttons on it. No. Oh, yeah. Okay. There there are some old souls in the audience. Okay. Uh but yeah, we don't want any like uh ellipses like this or, you know, sigma notation or anything like that. We just want a nice clean expression that you can put into a calculator. So, how could we go about computing it? Any ideas? What if what if we were to replace this uh 1 plus p with an x? Would would that make it any any easier? So we've got uh m + m x + m x^2 plus mx to the n minus one. Are people happier with this expression? Getting getting some nods. Okay. Uh what is it? Anybody remember? Yeah. Yeah. It's a geometric series. Okay. So, this is going to be m * uh 1 - x uh oops n over 1 - x. Okay. Uh, so you know, we knew this expression already. How could we check it? Or how how did you check it? I believe you already have. Yeah. Uh, oh, thank you. Uh yeah. Yeah, you're right. Thank you. So, um how could you prove this? Or how how would I have failed to prove it if I tried to do it just now? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so this is what we call the uh the guess and check method. Okay, so if we've got a sum like this and we know or we can reasonably guess a nice closed form for it, right? Then you know we can prove it by induction, right? That's that's fairly straightforward. The hard part is figuring out what that uh closed form should be. Okay. Uh and you know in this case the inductive step you know it reduces to you know some fairly simple algebra as you already saw I think in I think in recitation. Is that right? Recoach. Okay. Even if you don't remember Zach does. Okay. So, uh, how might we discover this this closed form if we didn't already know it, though? Any ideas? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. So this is what we call the perturbation method. So the answer was you know if we multiply this entire thing by x and uh you know subtract it then things will cancel. Okay. Uh so this is uh one example of what we call the perturbation method. Um this is something that uh does anybody know the story of um Gaus in the kindergarten or first grade when uh he was given a massive sum to evaluate by his teacher and uh you know 3 seconds he uh gave the teacher his answer and the teacher's like what the hell no go back to your seat. Okay. Yeah. So perturbation method in action. So Gaus was asked to evaluate you know 1 + 2 plus I think the story was 100 not actually sure and G observed that if you you know take this series and perturb it a little bit so in this case flip it around and then add them together you end up with something very nice Okay. Okay. So he's got you know two copies of this sum right? So 2s is equal to this thing which means that s should be equal to that. Okay so fairly straightforward. We can do the same thing with this geometric series here. [Applause] So for simplicity, I'm going to drop the m. So if instead we have s = 1 + x + x^2 + x nus1 and uh your your colleague said that we should multiply this by x. So xs equals I'm going to shift everything over so it's a little bit easier to see what's going on. Okay. And now this time instead of adding them we're going to want to subtract. This one doesn't have anything uh to subtract. Uh, and now here we've got, you know, plus x - x plus x^2 - x^2. So everything is going to cancel until we get to the end. And here we've got - x n. Okay, so now we've got s - x s is equal to 1 - x to the n, which means that s is 1 - x n over 1 - x. Okay, so if we, you know, didn't know the the formula for a geometric series off the top of our heads, which, you know, I clearly didn't, we could derive it like this and then we can check it by induction. Okay, does that make sense to everybody? So if we go back to our annuity example, we had uh so m was 50k, n is 20 years. uh P was uh 0533 which means that our X here was uh was it 1 over 1 - P 1 over one uh 1 + P. Okay. So if we plug this in, it turns out that uh the value of our annuity is actually about 638,000. Okay, so you know, it's it's not just less than the $1 million that we were promised. It's like substantially less, right? Okay. And uh you know what what if we uh what if we took an even more extreme example like suppose instead of uh 50,000 per year for 20 years we got $1 per year for a million years. You know for simplicity let's just say it's forever. Okay. So suppose we got $1 forever like every year forever. How much is that worth? Half a million. 100,000. Yeah. Yeah, it's about 20 bucks. Uh so this uh this x to the n just goes to zero. Turns out that if we have uh m = 1, n is infinity. Same p as we had before, it's about 20. Okay. So, you know, it might be a little bit counterintuitive that uh you know, getting money like forever, it's still has finite value, right? Um but yeah, I don't know. Maybe if you think about it, it it uh it kind of makes sense, right? Um like that that money that you're getting like n years from now, like you know, who cares? Like you're you're not even going to be alive to use it, right? So maybe it maybe it also kind of makes sense that it uh that it doesn't it's not worth very much. Uh and you know in the real world there are actually you know perpetual annuities like this. They they do exist. Um I believe there is a surviving one uh issued by a Dutch water company in the 17th century. Uh I think they issued five that are still around today. And one was acquired by Yale in uh let's see maybe 30 odd years ago I think uh for $24,000 and it gets them about $12 annually. So uh only worth it for the uh historical value. The uh the money is is a complete wash. Okay. So, are people reasonably happy with the uh perturbation method? Yeah, some thumbs up. Okay, so let's move on to a slightly different method for evaluating, you know, other sums. Uh so this is what's called the MSAT method. I'm spelling this correctly. I hope so. uh or if you don't like German I think it is uh you could also just call it the educated guess method. Okay. So suppose we have the following sum sum from k = 1 to n of k^ squ. Okay. So first does does anybody already know the answer? What what does this sum evaluate to? Oh nobody. Okay, in that case uh next question is open to everyone. Uh does anybody have any idea like what vaguely the solution might look like? Like yeah. Yeah, it should it should be some sort of cubic, right? Like we're we're summing up a bunch of squares. Well, n squares. Um, a bunch of them are, you know, about n^2. And so we should get something that's about n cubed. Okay. So guess uh s is you know approximately n cubed. Okay. Now it won't do us too much good to uh you know put that into our guess and check method. Yeah. Uh intuition basically. Um but uh so what one way you could think about it is uh so half of these terms are going to be larger than n /2 right? So that's 1/4 of n^2. Uh you've got n /2 of those. So you should have something that's at least 1/8 of n cubed. Does that make sense? Uh and then for an upper bound, right, you've got n terms which are all at most n^2. And so it's going to be, you know, something between 1/8 n cubed and n cubed itself. Does that kind of make sense? or hinting at something else that we'll do uh a little bit later. Uh if you squint really hard, a sum kind of looks like an integral. So if you integrate that, you're going to get something that looks like nubed. Okay. Uh another question. Yeah. Uh we could do that if you like. So we've got, you know, 1 + uh 2^ 2 + 3^ 2 + uh n / 2 squared plus all the way up to n^2, right? So these terms, you know, plus or minus one term if it's, you know, even or odd. So these are all greater than or equal to uh n /2 squared and we've got n over2 of them or n /2 + 1 or whatever. Okay, so the sum is going to be at least n /2 * n /2 is 1/8 n cubed. Okay. Yeah. Question. Yeah. [Music] Ah, okay. So, uh, we're getting a a more refined guess. Um, though actually I would argue that n cubed is already good enough uh for for what we're doing anyway. Um, and here's why. So, we we as as we said like we it's not very precise, right? like we don't know uh like you said the leading coefficient should probably be a third. Um but we're just going to start from you know guessing that it's a cubic of some sort. Okay, we don't know anything about the coefficients but you know it seems like a reasonable guess. Okay, so we're going to say that s is equal to a * n cubed + b n^ 2 + cn plus d. Okay, we're just going to take that on faith, assume it, and see where it leads us. Okay, so if we assume that, what can we deduce? Any ideas? How might we go about figuring out what A, B, C, and D should be? Well, what if we look at you know small n? So if we have say n equals 0, what happens if we put in n equals 0? Exactly. Okay. So then we have uh a * 0 cubed + b * 0 2 + c * 0 + d = what? What is the value of our sum at zero? Zero. Yeah, we've just got the empty sum. Okay. What else can we do? Yeah, n equals 1. That seems like another decent choice. And so this time we'll end up with a + b + c + d equals what? What's the value of our sum there? 1. And if we continue like this, we get uh 8 a + 4 b + 2 c + d = 5. So 1 + 4. Uh question. Uh no, we're trying to figure those out. So we're just taking it on faith that S has this form. Okay. Mhm. So we already know that because S was defined as the sum of squares. Okay. So if we sum up all of the squares up to n equals 1, we get one. If we sum them up to n equals 2, we get five. etc. Okay, is this enough? Yeah, we need one more. So, let's put in n equals 3. Here we've got 27 a + 9 b + 3 c + d = uh 14. Can I arithmetic at least? I think I can arithmetic. 1 plus 4 + 9. That sounds like 14. Okay, so now we've got a system of uh four equations and four variables. So we should be able to solve it. Okay. Um has anybody figured out what the solution is yet? Well, d equals 0. That's an easy one. Uh I think it turns out to be a =3 b = 12 c = 16. Is that right? And uh yeah, d equ= 0 because we've got a bunch of zeros here. Okay. So are we done? Have we found our solution? Yeah. Yeah. So, we we've maybe found our solution, but you know, we we don't know. We just pulled this out of a hat and assumed it. Okay. So, we should actually prove that this is correct. So now we're going to take uh you know s= 1/3 n cubed + uh 12 n^2 + 16 n and use that as our guess and go back to the guess and check method and prove this by induction. Okay. And uh we're actually going to want strong induction. These are our base cases. We've already proven that essentially like that's what we use to derive ABC and D. Okay? And our inductive step is just going to be a bunch of algebra. So I'm I'm not going to go into that right now, but uh yeah, if you're interested, feel free to prove it. Okay. Uh yeah, and uh if it works, we'll, you know, we'll have a proof that our uh that our formula was correct. And if it doesn't, you know, we go back to the drawing board. we uh we know that this form was wrong and so maybe we try and figure out you know a different form that that our answer might take. Okay. Uh does that make sense? Are people happy with that? Any questions? Maybe I should phrase it the other way. What's your name? Oh, I'm Bmore. Uh, like the Pennsylvania College. Same word spelled differently. Uh, I saw another hand over here. Was that was that a question or Yeah. So that that's if you if you solve this system of equations uh like that's that's what comes out like you you could do Gaussian elimination or you know invert the matrix or whatever. on your notes. Oh, no. I'm I'm not that good. Oh, I mean, no, I totally don't have it on my notes. Um, yeah. Yeah. Question. Yeah. Uh so as as we were discussing you know before we we dove into it right uh we think that it's probably going to look something like n cubed um we don't know exactly you know how close it is to that but it's kind of reasonable to assume that it's a polinomial like a cubic polinomial um so you know maybe we could have started with uh you know something like this instead head like maybe it's some constant time n cubed plus you know quadratic term and then you know the onsance method would have failed we would have uh uh we would have ended up with you know suspicious looking guess we would have tried to prove it by induction and it wouldn't have worked um but yeah as it turns out uh this is a reasonable Yeah. How do we know that means it's wrong? What if we just didn't figure out the right way? Ah, so the the question is if we have a bad guess and we can't prove it by induction, how do we know that the guess is actually wrong and not that uh you know we're doing something suspicious with the proof? Uh so that's a good question. Um, so maybe I should digress here a little bit. Uh, if you're trying to, you know, figure out a proof or a disproof disproof for a statement that you're not quite sure whether it's true or not, uh, often the thing that you'll want to do is attempt to prove it, see where your proof seems to be breaking, like if you if you find a block, like something that you can't figure out, and then try and use that to to generate disproof. uh and then you know you can iterate on that and uh you know if your if your disproof gets stuck somewhere like maybe you try and use that uh that block to try and come up with a different proof. Okay. Um and you know eventually hopefully you'll be able to come up with one or the other. Uh so in this case um there's a a you know fairly uh clear uh path towards a disproof you know put in more numbers right so we could try you know n= 4 right uh then we'd have 64 a + 16 b + 4 c + D should be equal to what is it? 30. Okay, so that's a decent sanity check, right? Like if that doesn't work, then you know we know that we've uh we've screwed something up. Okay, does that make sense to everybody? Yeah. Question. Uh so that's because we have uh four variables here. We've got a b c and d. So we needed four uh equations like four constraints. Yeah. Like we could equally well have chosen like n= 1, n= 2, n= 5 and n= 100. Uh it would have given us the correct answer. It just would have taken more uh complicated computation. Yeah. Uh oh. Here you mean? Oh, okay. So the the the squared term is right because you know each of these terms here is at least n over2 squ. Uh the last term is because there are n over2 of them and we're trying to evaluate the sum. So we're summing up n over2 things that are all at least n over2. They're at least zero. We don't care. Yeah. Okay. Are people reasonably happy with this? Yeah. Okay. So, let's move on to a third technique. Okay, so sometimes we're going to end up with uh you know sums of sums, right? Uh nested summations which we call double sums. So for instance, what if we had the following? So i = 1 to n of the sum from j = 1 to i of j. Okay. So now you know before we had uh the thing inside our sum was this nice simple expression k^ squ right now our sum and is itself a summation. Okay what can we do about that? How would we evaluate things like this? Mhm. Yeah. So the answer was to evaluate the inner sum first right figure out a closed form as a function of I right and then we can evaluate the outer sum okay so in this case what do we end up with what happens when we evaluate this inner sum I claim that this is something that we already know how to do something that we've seen for yeah exactly so this is the sum from i = 1 to n of i * i + 1 all divided by 2 okay now how could we evaluate this sum this this expression is a little bit more complicated than the ones that we had before Right. Is there a way that we can simplify it? Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. So, let's uh distribute this i and then break the sum up. Okay. So, uh if we distribute this, we end up with i^ 2 + i / 2. Okay. And now we've got a sum of you know a sum uh so we can split it into two different summations i = 1 to n i^2 plus sum of i. Okay, so I've taken each of these terms and split it into its own sum and also pulled this factor of 1/2 out in front. Okay, so this is now something that we know how to evaluate. We just evaluated it. Uh this is also something we know how to evaluate like also we just evaluated it. Uh so this comes out to the answer that we had there. So 16 n cubed + 1/4 n^2 + 112n uh plus 14 * n * n + 1. Okay. Does that make sense to everybody? Suppose instead we had something similar but slightly different. So sum from i + 1 to n sum from j = i to n of j. Oops. Okay. So our inner sum now instead of going from uh one to i, it's going from i to n. Okay. Now, we could evaluate this in the same way as as we just did, but it turns out that there's a slightly easier way. Okay, we can exchange the order of summation. Okay. And what I mean by that is that we want the outer sum to be in terms of J and the inner sum to be in terms of I. Okay. So what are the possible values of J? So uh yes. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Okay, so if I equals 1 here, J equals I, J equals 1. Okay, so that's the smallest value of J. And you know, J can clearly go up to N. Okay. Okay. What are the bounds of summation on our inner sum? How would we compute this? What constraints do we have on i and J originally? And we know that 1 is less than or equal to i less than or equal to n. i less than or equal to j less than or equal to n. Okay. So we could you know phrase this as 1 less than or equal to i less than or equal to j less than or equal to n. Okay. And now we've got bounds on i in terms of j. Does that make sense to everybody? So, we still want the sum over the same set of pairs I and J. We're just expressing it differently. And now our sumand is the same. Okay. Does it does it make sense to everybody how we got this? Yeah. Uh so this right just came from the bounds on our inner sum. Okay. We're saying that J should range from I up to N. Okay. And so then we just, you know, stick this pair of inequalities in here. Okay. Does that make sense to everybody? You reasonably happy with this? Okay. So now we've exchanged the order of summation. We've got uh J for our outer sum, I for inner sum, and now we've got a much simpler sum here that we can easily evaluate. Okay. What is our inner sum? Mhm. Yeah. Okay. The sumand has no dependence on the uh index of summation. Right. So we've just got J terms. All of them are J. So it's J squ. Okay. And now this is just the sum that we had before. Does that make sense to everybody? Yeah. Mhm. Uh this one here. Uh so that's that's just uh an expression that you've already seen, right? We we've already seen how to evaluate the sum from J= 1 to I of of J. Uh so that's just you know plugging in that closed formula uh for that inner sum. Okay. Are people reasonably happy with this? Yeah. Uh did we uh oh yeah here is I mean here it's the you know particular example where where n equals 100 but yeah okay so why don't we move on to The uh last topic for today. [Applause] So what happens if we have the following sum? Any idea how we might come up with a closed form for this? Does anybody already know a closed form? Nobody really. That's good because it's an open problem. Um, well, I suppose that doesn't make it good. If you have a closed form, you could write a paper about it. That would be pretty exciting. Uh okay. So it turns out that you know there isn't any nice close form for this as far as we know. Uh so does that mean we should just you know hands in the air give up? Getting some getting some nods. Yeah. I mean I suppose that's a that's a question of philosophy. Um but you know we can still say something about it right? like maybe we don't need to know exactly what this sum is. Uh but you know, as long as we figure out something that's close enough, maybe we're still happy. Okay, so maybe we want to approximate it. Okay. So, can anybody give me a guess as to an approximation for this sum? Mhm. So the answer was, you know, again, if we squint really hard and pretend that this is an integral, maybe s is approximately equal to the integral of rootx dx uh say from 1 to n, which is going to be about 2/3 uh n to the is it three halves? Is that about right? I swear I've done calculus before. Um, it's been a while. Uh, okay. So, the question then becomes, how close is that approximation? Do we think we're, you know, within a factor of two? Do you think we're off by, you know, n by root n off by one? Maybe it's not entirely clear. Okay. So, in order to figure this out, we're going to use what we call the integral method. So, give me a moment to draw this. And you know, Redux looks a little bit like that if you squint really hard. Okay. Um so suppose we have a weekly increasing function of x. So rootx is indeed weakly increasing. So that that'll work. Um now recall remon sums from uh from integral calculus. Okay. No no post-traumatic stress. Are we are we okay? Okay. Uh so how could we how could we approximate uh the integral of f ofx yeah yeah so if we've got one 2 3 4 dot dot dot we can draw a bunch of rectangles like this. Okay. And this step function here. Actually, maybe I should get a different color. Okay, for completeness maybe I should do that. Okay, so this this step function here that I've drawn is uh f of the floor of x, right? f is weekly increasing. So that means you know floor of x is an under approximation for x. So f of floor of x is an under approximation for f ofx. Okay. Now what happens if we integrate the step function? What is the integral from 1 to n of f of floor of x? Yeah, sorry. uh almost. So in in this case it actually does it turn out to be s uh yeah exactly we're we're missing a term here. Okay, so we can break this into n minus one integrals, right? We've got a an interval of width n minus one. Uh this is constant on each of those uh width one uh sub intervals, right? So we can break it break it apart into a whole bunch of rectangles. So this is going to be the sum from i = 1 to n minus one of f of i. Does that make sense to everybody? So we've got intervals of width one. Uh our function is constant on each of those intervals, right? And it's equal to, you know, the left hand uh the left hand side of that interval. Okay, does that make sense to everybody? And this is just going to be s minus uh f of n. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Uh so the question is why are we using n minus one as the bound here? Okay, so that's because the width of this interval is n minus one. We're splitting into n minus one intervals of width one. Okay, so for instance, if we uh you know went up to say n= 5. Okay. So if we were trying to sum f of one, f of two, f of three, f of four, f of five, uh we would then want to compare to this integral here. So the integral from 1 to 5, right? And this gives us four rectangles, right? We've got the interval from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5. Okay. And the uh the interval say from 2 to three has width 1 and height f of two. Okay. So you know maybe we could phrase this as you know 1 * f of i. Does that make sense? Okay. So now we've you know we've got uh so we've got an under approximation for our integral now. So uh I haven't actually written the the integral. So let's let I equal the integral from 1 to n fx dx. Okay, so we said that this function here under approximates f, right? So this integral under approximates i. So that tells us that i is greater than or equal to s minus f of n. Okay. Now, equivalently, we could phrase this as a bound on S in terms of I, right? Because S was what we originally wanted to figure out. Okay? So, instead, we could write this as S is less than or equal to I plus F of N. Does that make sense? Okay. Now what if instead we over approximated? Okay, so now we've got f of the ceiling of x. Sorry. So the new step function that I've just drawn in green is f of ceiling of x which is an over approximation for f ofx. Okay. So if we integrate it, the integral from 1 to n of f of ceiling of x dx should be greater than or equal to i. Okay. Now doing exactly the same thing as we had before. What is this integral? Yeah. Yeah. So sum from i = 2 to n of f of i say times 1, right? And this is just sus f of one. Okay. So s minus f of one is at least i. Once again we can rephrase this as a bound on i or sorry a bound on s in terms of i. So I uh sorry S is greater than or equal to I + F of 1. Okay, does that make sense to everybody? So putting these together now we have I + f of 1 less than or equal to s less than or equal to i + f of n. Okay. So this is what we call the integral bound for increasing functions. Are people reasonably happy with this? Okay. So if we go back to our original question, you know, where f ofx equals rootx, right? What are the bounds we get? What is i first? wasn't quite what I wrote down before. Yeah, it is from 1 to n. Remember what I wrote originally was uh 2/3 n^ 3 which is I believe the integral from 0 to n. So what we actually have here is I = the integral from 1 to n of x^ 12 dx which is equal to 2/3 x^ 3s evaluated at one and n which is going to be 2/3 * n^ 3 - 1. Okay, so almost what we had before. So our lower bound then is this value plus f of one, right? f of one is just root one. it's one and our upper bound is I plus roo<unk> n. Okay, so it turns out that 2/3 n^ 3 halves is a pretty good approximation, right? It's uh you know it's going to be a little bit larger than that but not much, right? we're going to be within an additive root n. Okay. And you know given that our approximation is you know a cube of that that's actually pretty good. Okay. Does that make sense to everybody? Are we reasonably happy with that? Okay. What if instead we had you know s equals sum from i = 1 to n of say 1 / i. Can we apply our integral bound to this? It thinks yes. Who thinks no? Okay. Can anybody explain why in either direction? Yeah. Uh okay. So the answer was uh you know after one uh it's going to converge. Uh I would dispute that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. So even if we could apply the integral bound, it may not get us very far. Uh I think there's a bigger problem here. Yeah, that's right. So remember that our assumption, right, was that f should be weekly increasing. One over i is not or 1 /x is not. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the observation here is that if we take f ofx = 1 /x this is weekly decreasing. So we can do something similar. Okay, what exactly are we going to do? Well, let's take g of x to be equal to f of n + 1 - x. Okay. Now, what do we know about g? So basically what we've done here, right, we are essentially negating the argument. So we're kind of flipping it horizontally, right? We started with a weekly decreasing function. So when we flip it like this, we're going to end up with a weekly increasing function. Okay. Yeah. Ah. Uh, so are you worried about the n plus one as opposed to the n? Yeah. Okay. So basically we are mapping uh one to n and vice versa and then everything in between should just you know interpolate linearly. Okay. So if we put you know one into here we end up with f of n. If we put n into here we end up with f of one. Does that make sense? So the question is why do we have the uh n plus one there instead of just an n or a minus x or something like that? which you know kind of gets into the the next question. What is S in terms of G? So maybe it would be better to write it using ellipses instead of sigma notation. So we defined it as f of 1 plus f of 2 plus dot dot dot plus f of n. Okay. Now how can we rewrite this in terms of g? Yeah. Okay, so this is actually equal to the sum of G of I same balance. Okay. So now what can we do? Mhm. Yeah, G satisfies all of the uh requirements that we needed for our integral bound. Okay, so we can apply the integral bound now to G instead of to our original F. Okay. So now uh we know that I + g of 1 less than or equal to s less than or equal to i + g of n. Okay. So the integral is exactly the same, right? We are, you know, we've just flipped it, right? But the area under it is is going to be the same. And what is this g of one? Well, this g of one is just f of n. g of n is just f of one. Okay, so this is the integral bound for weekly decreasing. F. Okay. Does that make sense to everybody? Yeah. Uh, strictly speaking, uh, Um so you end up with a uh a slightly different problem if you uh if you just negate it. Um which is well I'll hint at it in a moment. Okay. Uh what happens if you take limits as n goes to infinity? Pardon? Yeah. So you kind of have to um like you you can do that but you you'd have to kind of adjust for it and it doesn't work quite as nicely with the with limits. Uh so the answer is strictly speaking yes. You could negate it if you want to. uh but uh you know flipping it and you know I personally find it easier to think about but yeah so that that that was the idea to to negate f instead of x. Okay. But uh yeah, segue into the uh the last thing. We've got a couple of minutes or eight minutes. Oh, nice. Um so what about s= sum from i = 1 to infinity of let's say because as somebody pointed out we do not want to be working with logs. So let's say 1 over i^2. Okay. So how could we evaluate this infinite sum? Well, we can basically do what we were just doing, right? So, well, does does anybody remember how we actually define what an infinite sum is? It's just going to be a limit of partial sums. Okay. Now all of these we know how to evaluate. Okay. So each of these if we take you know i subn to be equal to the integral from 1 to n of 1 i^2 oh sorry 1x^2 dx okay what is this integral Anybody want to evaluate that? No. We don't like calculus. Me too. That's why I'm asking for help. Yeah. Yeah. 1 - 1 / n. Okay. Why are you laughing at me? That's so rude. Ah, come on guys. Okay, so we know what these partial sums are or you know we have approximations for these partial sums. Okay, so the partial sum s subn is going to be bounded on one side by uh okay oops why don't I write it like this? So I subn plus f of n less than or equal to s subn less than or equal to i subn plus f of 1. Okay. Now what happens when we take limits? So weak inequalities are preserved by limits. Right? So the limit of I subn plus f of n is going to be less than or equal to s less than or equal to limit of i subn plus f of 1. Okay. Now, what does the limit do? Well, we can separate these. What's the limit of I of subn? Yep. Mhm. uh 1 - 1 / infinity basically, right? So as n goes to infinity, this 1 / n term disappears. Okay, so this part is just going to be one. What's the limit of f of n? Yeah, also infinity. Uh also yeah zero less than or equal to s less than or equal to we just established that this is one. What's f of one? One. Okay. So we have an approximation. Is it a good one? I'm seeing some people like, "Yeah, good enough. Let's just go home." Some people like, "What the hell? We're off by a factor of two." Uh, yeah, it's between one and two. Like, not so great. Any ideas how we could make it better? How could we make our bones more precise? Maybe if we go back to the picture, it'll be a little bit uh easier to see. Okay. So this lack of precision is coming from the fact that like you know we're kind of looking at the difference between these two step functions, right? So the farther apart they are the the worse our our approximation is going to be. Okay. So if we kind of just forget about the first few terms, compute those exactly, and then just approximate the rest, we're going to end up with a more precise bound. Okay? So if instead we say you know s = uh 1 + 14 + 1 9th plus the sum from i = 1 to infinity of 1 / i + 3^ 2. Sorry, it's a bit crowded. Okay. Now, what happens if we approximate this sum? How close are we going to get? Well, our error term remember was just the first term in our series. Okay, we are going to be between the integral and the integral plus the first term. Okay, here the first term is much smaller. Okay, so this time we've got uh what is it? 1 16. So instead of being, you know, between i and i + 1, we're now between i and i + 1 over 16 for a different eye. Same I, no, different eye. Yeah. Okay. Does that make sense to everybody? So if you want a better approximation, just, you know, strip some terms off the front and approximate the tail of the sum instead of the entire thing. So that's all we have time for today. Uh let's see. I'm not sure who will see you next week. Um somebody will see you next week. Zach will see you next week. Uh feel free to come up if you have any questions. Yeah. started. Uh your role
