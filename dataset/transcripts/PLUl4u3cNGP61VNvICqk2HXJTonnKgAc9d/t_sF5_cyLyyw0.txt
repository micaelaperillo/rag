hello everybody can people hear me in the back is it working cool okay so um I believe that uh last time we started uh counting and you saw the uh the sumr in particular um so let's uh let's take a look at a quick example so I've got a a very standard deck of playing cards here as you can see uh how many kings and queens are there eight why is that yeah so the the the answer was that there are four suits uh for for each rank we've got therefore Four Kings Four Queens nothing is both a king and a queen so you can kind of just add them together right you've got eight cards that are either Kings or Queens okay uh what if the sets are not disjoint so what if I instead wanted to count the number of cards that are either hearts or face cards so that then what do I do so I've got uh you know 12 face cards here my my hands are a little bit too small for playing cards but you know hopefully you can roughly see right how many hearts are there yeah 13 Hearts so 13 hearts in one hand 12 face cards in the other so uh 25 no what's gone wrong can anybody tell me what's gone wrong yeah yeah I've got two kings of Hearts here so I'm I'm cheating uh okay so what what do yeah exactly so the answer was you know I've got three cards that are both hearts and face cards right so these are the three cards that I've counted twice right I've got uh two each of these three cards so if I just like discard one copy then I'll be fine right so I subtract off everything that's in the intersection uh so I had 25 before subtract off those three and I end up with 22 that are either hearts or uh well these cards are too big maybe I should have actually brought standard cards uh I've got 22 cards that are either hearts or or face cards okay does that make sense to people okay so this is what we call the uh inclusion exclusion role or the principle of inclusion and exclusion so often abbreviated as uh Pi for principle of inclusion exclusion okay so if I have two two sets A and B and I want to compute their Union right uh the size of this Union oh well this chalk is terrible um sorry the size of their Union is going to be the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of the intersection okay does that make sense to everybody maybe a little bit easier to see if we uh draw a picture right so hopefully people REM remember uh ven diagrams from uh from grade school yeah maybe no well this is a ven diagram couple of overlapping circles so maybe we've got hearts on one side and we've got uh faces on the other right but then we've got some things that are in the middle so this can be our set a this can be our set B and here we've got King of Hearts Queen of Hearts and Jack of FS okay so if we want to compute the size of the Union right we're going to take the things that are like only on the heart side the things that are only on the face side and then the things that are in the intersection we only want to count them once right but that's counted in both of A and B right so we're going to add together the sizes of A and B and then subtract out the middle okay does that make sense to everybody okay so what happens if we have three sets any ideas well can we do something similar so let's draw a three-way vend diagram this time okay so we've got a here B here C here so is it true that whoops a union B Union C C is equal to the sum of the individual sets minus the parway intersections oops that should be a b is this true yeah yeah okay so your classmates's observation was that uh these intersections themselves overlap right so if we think about how many times we've counted each each item right everything here we've only counted once everything here we've only counted once everything here we've only counted once okay that's that's fairly easy uh what about the things in these uh kind of weirdly shaped segments right so those appear in you know two of the individual sets and in one of the par wise intersections so we've also counted these ones okay but now we've got a problem in the middle right how many times have we counted this well we've counted it once for a once for B once for C and then we've subtracted it once each for a intersect B A intersect C and B intersect C Okay so we've counted this zero times in total okay so what we actually want is to add back in the three-way intersection okay and that gives us the correct formula okay does does that make sense to everybody yeah okay so let's take a look at an example then uh how many uh numbers uh K in the range from 1 to n are co-prime with n how could we figure this out and those of you who already know the toen function don't invoke that how could we use uh the principle of inclusion exclusion to compute this any ideas tentative hands maybe yeah see okay so the idea was look at uh you know which which numbers uh share prime factor with n okay so for Simplicity let's assume for now that n is the product of say three primes PQ and R okay so then how could we figure out how many things share a factor of P yeah you div y right yeah so they're going to be uh n/ P that share a factor of of P so let's say that uh let's call the set a subp the uh set of numbers and the the subset of these numbers that that share a factor of P okay so they're going to be n/ P of those what about the things that share a factor of Q same thing right so similarly we can define a sub Q to be the the set of numbers that share a factor of Q and then we've got this and similarly a subr is going to be the set of things that share a factor of R okay now what exactly are we trying to compute what we really want is the complement of the Union of these three sets right so we're trying to compute the size of n minus a union AQ Union a r okay okay so now we can use inclusion exclusion we're trying to compute the union of this set right that's going to be the sum of the sizes of the individual sets right minus the oh I did this the wrong way around didn't I uh oh no I didn't that was the right one so the the sum of the individual sizes minus the sum of the parse uh intersections plus the sum of the three-way intersection okay so what are the sizes of these intersections what's the size of the intersection of AP and AQ yeah yeah so the answer was n/ PQ right so p and Q are distinct primes if something shares both a factor of p and a factor of Q it has to be a multiple of PQ okay so they're n/ PQ of those similarly we have n / p r and N / QR what what about the three-way intersection how many things share a factor of PQ and R yeah yeah it's just n itself so minus one okay and if you do some uh you know messy algebra this turns out to uh P minus one Q - one r - one which is also equal to n * 1 - 1 / p uh 1 - 1 / Q 1 - 1 / R okay so hopefully it's not too hard to see how this could generalize right uh to get you know the more general form of of oil totient okay does this application make sense to people any questions yeah oh that's just the assumption that we made you for the sake of example okay so that's inclusion exclusion with uh two or three sets but more generally you can kind of continue the pattern right so if you have say n sets uh A1 A2 all the way up to a subn and you want to figure out the union of all of these right so as we did before we're going to add up the individual sizes of the uh uh of the individual sets Okay then we're going to subtract off the pawise intersections okay then we're going to add in the three-way intersections right and we're just going to keep on going okay until eventually we get to you know plus or minus the size of the nway intersection so A1 cap A2 Cap all the way to a subn okay and the the sign on that last term will depend on you know the parody of n okay does that make sense to people so perhaps a more formal way of expressing this is the following so suppose we have some set u uh which we're going to say is a union of uh n sets Okay so this is going to be our universe of discourse okay uh and so this means that you know by convention if we intersect no sets right this is just going to be uh U okay so just like if we Union no sets we start with nothing and then you know start unioning in more things and we should get a union of sets if we start with everything and then start intersecting we should get an intersection of sets so that's that's where this convention comes from yeah oh uh this this notation this notation both oh okay so this is kind of like the uh the big Sigma right so uh just how this represents like an nway addition uh this represents an nway Union and this represents an nway intersection right uh so we've got this is saying we've got a union of n sets like A1 Union A2 Union A3 Union a n okay uh and this is saying you know we've got an intersection of n sets but n is zero so by convention we just take that to be the entire universe sorry uh the the question is why are we setting both the union and the intersection to be U uh this is just how we're defining youu this is a convention right so if if you intersect no sets right you should get everything just like if you multiply no numbers you should get one it's kind of similar to that right like you know you start with everything and then you intersect one you should get the set that you that you intersected in right okay so this is just a convention uh if you prefer you can just write in U itself and and what I'm about to write that might make it easier to understand sorry about that uh okay so the theorem is that uh if you look at all subsets of the numbers up to n right and you take uh the like ey way intersection of these AIS right and then multiply it by minus one to the size of I this should give you zero okay so now if you want to think about this in the case of the 2way inclusion exclusion here right so this is saying uh you know zero equals like we move the the union over to the right hand side okay or I guess we're moving everything over to the left hand side based on what I've written okay yeah okay uh so this formula is basically what we were doing here like we're we're kind of taking uh eyeway intersections and we're you know flipping the sign on on successive you know sizes of I right and we're just kind of moving this Union over to the other side right so we get zero okay so if that formula is is too much you can think about the previous formula but uh yeah okay so the the question was the like what is the difference between big and little I so big I is a set of indices little I is an individual IND index in that set okay so we're summing over you know all subsets of the numbers up to n right and then for each of those subsets we're taking the intersection of the relevant AIS right so over here we've got a is you know just it corresponds to the subset just one B corresponds to the subset 2 uh a intersect B corresponds to the subset you know 1 comma 2 and a union B corresponds to the empty subset okay so these are all of the subsets of uh the integers one and two does that make sense question uh size of I right because I is a set yeah so the question is why do we have absolute value here that's the the cardinality okay so how could we prove this well let's look at some X okay so say that you know we've got some element X of our universe how many times do we count X on this left hand side like how many of these terms does it appear in well it's going to be in all of the terms where X is in you know all of these uh AIS okay so if we say like I subx is the set of indices with uh X and AI okay right it's going to be in the uh I subx set it's also going to be in the in like every subset of I subx okay does that make sense do people see why right if x is in sets one and two right it's going to be in the uh in the in the intersection where we've got you know I is 1 two it's also going to be in the intersection where I is one or where I is two or where I is empty okay but now how much does it contribute to the left hand side for each of these well how many subsets of I subx have even size and how many have odd size yeah yeah it's half each right so for the ones of odd size we're contributing minus one to the left hand side for the ones of even size we're contributing positive one to the right hand side or to the left hand side right so because they're half and half those all cancel okay [Music] so X contributes + one to left hand side for each even size subset of I subx and it contributes minus one to the left hand side for each odd siiz subset okay so when we add when we add all of those together we get zero okay so every element of our universe contributes zero to the left hand side so we get zero okay does that make sense to people yeah uh yes we're we're looking at the uh sorry question was are those both supposed to be left hand side we're looking at what x contributes to this sum okay like how many of these terms does it contribute positively to how many does it contribute negatively to so whenever the uh size of I is even it's going to contribute positively if it's contained in that intersection whenever the size of I is odd it'll contribute negatively when it's in the intersection okay yeah uh sorry the the question was how do we construct a big I so that the intersection is the empty Set uh okay let let me let me see if I'm understanding um you are trying to find an I such that uh this is empty or such that this is empty this one okay so we don't care uh we are looking at the sets that contain X so they should never be empty okay like we're we're kind of looking at uh you know what we had here like how many times have we counted X okay so if this is still confusing uh please review the lecture notes or uh you know it's not important that the proof is not important the most important thing is you know knowing how to use it right so you want to add together the the uh the single sets subtract off the the parse intersections add together the three-way intersections Etc okay so let's move on to the second topic for today Pidgey hole principle okay has anybody heard of this before yeah okay uh so the pidy hole principle it gets its name from you know Medieval Times you have uh a bunch of you know Pidgey holes that are supposed to contain pidgeys uh but what if you have more pidgeys than Pidgey holes right what happens well two of them have to share right two of them get squished okay so that's basically what the uh what the pidal principle is saying if we have two sets A and B where uh the size of a is greater than the size of B and F from A to B is total right then F cannot be injective right so if a is our set of pigeons right B is our set of pigeon holes and F is saying you know pigeon a lives in pigeon hole B right uh this should be a total function right like every Pidgey should have a home right we don't want to have homeless pidgeys uh so it's a total function right but that means that it can't be injective meaning that there have to be two pigeons that share a pigeon hole okay so let's look at a couple of [Applause] examples do we still have 26 students in the room nice not too many students have dropped okay so there are more than 26 students in the room so at least two of you uh share the first letter of your first name right uh so we've got well at least students and 26 letters of the alphabet so if we map every student right right to the first letter of their first name right that's a total function so it can't be injective okay so two students must share okay does that example make sense right okay uh what if I've got n differently colored pairs of socks right don't worry about it how many socks do I need to pull out of my drawer to ensure that I get two of the same color sorry yeah the answer was uh n plus one right so in my case two so if I've got n socks or sorry n colors of socks need n+ one to guarantee a pair okay so I've been a little bit handwavy with this one when you're trying to prove something with the pigeon hole principle you generally need to be very careful about what your pigeons are what your pigeon holes are and what the map between them is okay so what are those three elements in this case maybe we could phrase it instead as you know if I have n plus one then it guarantees a pair yeah okay so a is the set of socks and B is a set of colors and the map is going to map the sock to its color okay does that make sense to everybody okay uh does anybody know what the population of Boston is are you looking at the lecture notes oh okay yeah about 650,000 as of you know however many decades ago these lecture notes were written um I don't actually know that that was very long ago it could be current [Applause] is anybody a uh human biology nerd does anybody know how many hairs humans have so it turns out humans have less than about 200,000 hairs okay so what does the pitch and hole principle tell us here any ideas getting some face Palms yeah oh good point so the answer was at least three uh humans in Boston have the same number of pairis okay so as stated all we know is that you know at least two bostonians have the same number of hairs right so does that mean that there's somebody with the same number of hairs as me not necessarily right uh so we know that there exists two bostonians we don't know who they are right uh this this is non-constructive right it it only tells us of existence uh but your your colleague also brings up another good point uh because this 650,000 is so much larger than the 200,000 we can actually say something stronger right like all we need is is 200,000 plus 1 right that'll give us a a a of two bostonians right we've actually got more than three times that number right so there are more than three bostonians who have the same number of hairs so in fact we can conclude that there are at least four bostonians who all have the same number of hairs okay does that make sense to everybody yeah did ah so the the question was how did we get the four right so this is what we call the generalized pigeon hole principle okay so up here right we just said you know if a is is larger than b but if we have the stronger condition that if a is larger than K * B right right then we've got a K plus 1way Collision not just a two-way Collision okay so because you know we have 650,000 which is more than three times 200,000 we've got a 3 plus oneway Collision not just a three-way Collision does that make sense yeah yeah uh I suppose we could include zero but I guess there're everybody knows that there're are bald bostonians so maybe we exclude that um but yeah every natural number from uh from one up to 200,000 was is going to be our B and our a is going to be the set of all bostonians right and we are mapping a person to the number of pairs that they have okay okay so you can like you can basically always use the generalized uh pigeon hole principle if you would you know just like strong induction will always work whenever whenever weak induction does uh you could always set k equal 1 right uh but like the the proof is basically the same um and if you use these to uh to to prove things about functions uh the proofs can often be you know very short very simple uh but they can Al they can also sometimes require some cleverness okay so it it may not always be obvious what a b and F should be okay so here here's a slightly more involved example okay so we have an 8 by8 chest board and 33 Rooks does everybody know how uh how chess works you know vaguely okay so Rooks can move along you know ranks or files right ranks or files sorry um so we would like to place these these Rooks so that uh no five or so that any set of five right uh they don't all attack each other or no I I phrased that wrong uh so we want to find five of them where none of them attack each other right so basically we want them all to be in distinct uh rows and files so if we've got you know something like this right if we have a rook here a rook here and a rook here those three do not attack each other okay so we're trying to find a set of five like that right like no two of them share a column or a row does the uh does the setup make sense okay how could we do that rather how could we prove the existence of such a set maybe it would help to draw out the chessboard let's see one two three four five six 7 one two three four five six seven okay there's our wonky chest board okay so how could we do this any ideas yeah okay so the answer is if we place four Rooks they cover at most 2 to the five squares uh is that true uh I don't think that's true right like if we place Rooks in these four uh squares right they're going to cover 3/4 of the chessboard okay uh yes uh that's right pardon uh so what what is your solution then oh oh sorry I think you may have misunderstood the problem um you know we we have 33 Rooks right we're trying to find a set of five that don't attack each other we're we're given the placement right we're not allowed to just Place five Rooks if we could place them then yeah we could we could you know place them along a diagonal and then we've got eight right so like you know some of these have have Rooks we don't get to control where right right and we're trying to find some subset of these uh some subset of five of these that don't attack each other does the problem setup make sense maybe yes no yeah okay so how could we use the pigeon hole principle here well perhaps let's start with the easiest element what should our pigeons be what are we trying to make Collide yeah Rooks yeah so our pigeons are going to be the Rooks and I've lost my Eraser okay now what should our pigeon holes be right we want we want to set it up so that if we get a five-way collision right those five Rooks do not attack each other yeah yeah so the answer was you know we're placing these Rooks on the chest board so let's make the pigeon holes the uh the squares of the chest board okay so you are off to a good start that's a good idea uh the problem right now is that we've got uh fewer Rooks than squares on the chessboard okay so what we really want is a five-way collision right so we want to ensure that we have more than four times as many Brooks as pigeon holes okay so is there a way that we can modify your solution uh to make you know fewer things where Collision is still good for us so can we can we subdivide our squares so we have yeah sorry okay the the answer was squares that don't have rope Rooks um that's not going to be very helpful right like we're we're assigning Rooks to Pigeon holes so the the you know the map should map Rooks to you know occupied squares of of some sort but how could we maybe split up the chessboard into eight pigeon holes right if we have eight pigeon holes 33 Rooks right that's more than four times as many so we get a five-way collision what could our eight sets of squares be yeah colums okay so if we have five Rooks in a column is that helpful now all of those Works attack each other then you're getting close though yeah yeah so the answer was you know diagonals but then offset them okay so I'm going to number all of these squares so so everything numbered one is going to be our first pigeon hole okay so if we get five Rooks along the main diagonal like all of them are going to be in different rows and different columns so they won't attack each other okay so that's good right number two is going to be offset by one but then we're also going to wrap around down here okay so once again we've got eight squares that are all in different rows and different columns so if we get five on you know two squares they also don't attack each other okay and we can continue in this way right three goes along here and then these two squares Etc okay so now we have uh eight pigeon holes 33 Rooks so that's more than four times as many we get a five-way collision uh whichever you know number of square has that five-way Collision those are five Rooks that don't attack each other okay does does that make sense to everybody so it took a little bit of creativity to come up with the pigeon holes here but once we have that the proof is fairly straightforward okay so let's change gears a little bit and move on to uh the last counting technique for today which we call combinatorial proofs or double counting oops okay okay so I like to think of this as somewhat similar to uh I believe you've seen the baction rule earlier right so if you have two sets and you can come up with a baction between them then those two sets have the same size right well similarly if you have two sizes and a single set that shares those sizes right those sizes must be equal okay so basically this is a proof technique where we take a set and kind of count it in two different ways okay and that can give us some nice combinatorial identities so for instance we have this identity have people seen this one before no okay so if you uh if you sum up and choose k for you know all K from 0 to n you just get 2 the N so if you haven't seen it before it's you know perhaps a little bit counterintuitive right like we've got a summation of you know a bunch of things involving factorials but it turns out to be some nice uh exponential okay so how could we prove this how could we come up with a set that we can count you know both as this expression and as this expression any ideas yeah so the solution was count length and binary sequences okay so how does that give you each side of the uh of the equality okay exactly yeah so the the right hand side is fairly straightforward right right if we're counting length and binary sequences like every uh position you can either have zero or one right so product rule gives us to the n and for the left hand side we're going to partition based on how many ones there are in our sequence okay so our sequence could have any number of ones from0 up to n inclusive okay so and all of these are disjoint right if it has three ones it can't also have eight ones okay so by our sum rule we can just sum up all of the sizes of those sets what is the size of the set of sequences that has say three ones anybody how many binary sequences of length n have three ones n choose three yeah or more generally you know they n choose k with k1s and you know K from one through uh from zero through n form a partition of our set okay so if we sum up all of these binomial coefficients from 0 to n right we're also going to get the the number of length then binary sequences okay does that does that make sense to everybody okay does the proof technique make sense to everybody right we're we're taking a single set and we're counting it in two different ways right and each way of counting gives us a different expression so those two expressions must be equal okay so the key here you know is choosing the right set to count so as it turns out that's actually a special case of a uh of a nice theorem uh so we we've been using binomial coefficients quite a lot right these uh n choose K uh terms does anybody know their eponym any ideas has anybody encountered the binomial theorem before no okay well let's take a look Okay so okay so this here is what we call a binomial right uh you know sum of two monomials uh and the binomial theorem says that if we take a binomial raise it to the N power right then we get you know basically the same thing as we had on the left hand side over there but you know we've got these uh powers of X and Y okay and you know by convention 0 to the 0o we just say that that's equal to one okay so the uh uh the proof does anybody know how we might prove this it's fairly similar to what we just did well what happens if we expand out the left hand side what do we get yeah okay uh so the answer was we got the coefficients of Pascal's triangle uh you've skipped a couple of steps more immediately what do we get like say if n equals 2 what do we get we get XX plus X Y plus YX plus y y right like we've basically got a bunch of binary sequences of x's and y's okay so this gives us a sum of 2 to the N uh terms of the form uh and I'll call it you know B1 B2 up to BN where each B is either X or Y okay so now how do we get Pascal out of that so you're talking about coefficients what are these Coe like what are the coefficients of where are we getting the coefficients not quite of X and Y so we're going to want to group like terms right so both multiplication and addition are commutative so we can kind of fiddle around with uh each of those terms and you know put all the X's at the beginning and the Y's at the end and then we can also rearrange the terms so that you know we put like terms together okay so we can group them into a bunch of uh terms of the form at x k * y nus k uh and then multiplied by su coefficient C subk okay so now as your colleague was saying right those C subk are going to be you know the entries of Pascal's triangle they're going to be the uh binomial coefficients okay why is that well how many terms are there of this form well it could come from putting the K x's in you know any K places from among the uh uh the N possible places right so you've got n choose K possible places or possible ways to place the X's the Y's will be the the remaining ones uh and each of those gives you a different term okay so C subk is going to be n k similar to above does that make sense to everybody so if we specifically put in X and Y are both equal to one then we recover what we had uh originally you may also have uh encountered uh a form of this theorem where y equals 1 have have people seen that before like 1 plus x to the uh to the N possibly maybe not okay well it is a useful theorem the coefficients on the terms are the uh you know n chose K the binomial coefficients and you know this is where their name comes from okay and uh more generally you can also get the uh multinomial theorem in the same way right if you have uh you know X Plus y+ Z for instance raise that to the nth power uh you start getting multinomial coefficients instead of binomial coefficients okay yeah sorry I'm moving all the way over here I didn't plan this up very well okay so for the multinomial theor right if we have a multinomial here like we've got mx's instead of just two right uh if we sum all those up and then raise it to the N power we can use essentially the same proof to show that this is going to be the sum over all uh sequences K1 K2 all the way up to K subm uh where these all sum up to n of the multinomial coefficient and choose K1 K2 up to km of you know similar to the uh x to the k y the N minus K term we had over there this time we've got a product of M things okay so essentially the same proof right uh you know if we uh uh if we think of the uh the binom coefficients right as you know multinomial coefficients where we've only got two things right you can kind of see how it expands right uh we're going to look at you know all possible ways that you could you know Place x1's x2s x3s Etc uh among the N different terms uh and each of those is going to give us a different term that we can then combine uh when we're grouping like terms does that make sense to people so the number of those the number of ways that you can you know permute those uh those nend things that's just going to be this multinomial coefficient here [Applause] okay are people happy with the uh binomial multinomial coefficients and the binomial multinomial theorems yeah uh so the the question is uh what what does this mean um is this the notation that you saw in the bookkeeper uh recitation uh perhaps not if if not this is uh equal to n factorial / K1 factorial K2 factorial all the way up to km factorial okay so it's kind of an extension of the binomial coefficients right with the binomial coefficients you just have you know two k that sum to n uh and we also kind of simplify the notation by just you know dropping one of the uh dropping one of the ks because it's redundant in that case uh but you know for the multinomial coefficients we have you know a bunch of KS that sum to n instead of just two uh we're going to divide n factorial by you know the product of all of them okay does that does that make sense does that answer your question okay any other questions about binomial multinomial theorems yeah sorry oh question what is the pi uh so this is an analog of Sigma but for products instead of sums so we're saying you know x i to the Ki like multiplied over all possible I so X1 to the K1 * X2 to the k 2 time X3 to the K3 Etc okay so Pi for product any other questions okay so why don't we move on to another useful identity that we can prove using a uh a combinatorial proof oops and choose k equals n -1 choose Kus one plus nus one choose K okay who has seen this before I know that at least one of you has few hands okay uh so uh we could prove it you know algebraically just you know writing them out with factorials and you know doing a bunch of fiddly garbage uh but that seems a bit difficult so let's use a double counting proof instead okay how might we use a double counting proof to prove this identity what set could we try and count any ideas yeah yeah good answer okay so the the answer was uh you know once again we can look at binary sequences of length n but this time we're going to restrict it to Binary sequences of length n that specifically have k1s okay so count uh binary sequences of length n with k1s okay now how many of those are there does that give us one of our two expressions easily if so which yeah sorry yeah so essentially by definition right like this is equal to the the size of this set is going to be and choose k okay so let's call this set s okay how could we also make S equal to the right hand side does this give us any ideas yeah answer yeah yeah so the the answer was essentially we're going to par our set okay so what are we partitioning on well we're going to look at the last bit of the sequence okay [Music] so okay so so we've got two cases right the last bit can either be zero or one it can't be both right so we've got you know we've got a partition okay that means that we can use the sum rule we can count each of these sets individually and then add their sizes together that'll give us the size of our original set okay so how many length and sequence with k1s have a one at the end yeah yeah so the answer was n minus one choose K minus one okay so let's partition this s s0 Union S1 s0 or let's call it S Sub B is the set of binary sequences with n1's uh sorry n Bits k1s and B at the end okay so S Sub 1 is going to have size n minus1 chose Kus one right if we know that we've got a one at the end right we've got K minus one additional ones that we need to place right where can they go into any of the first n minus one positions okay so there are n minus one choose K minus one ways to choose those and what about s yeah yeah this is going to be n minus one choose K and why is that yeah if we've got a zero at the end right we still need to place those k1s somewhere right so now we've only got nus one places where we can put them but we still have k1s that we need to place okay so there n minus1 choose K ways to place them okay so these two cases are exhaustive right you can't have uh like you can't have a sequence that ends with nether a zero or one it's a binary sequence right they're also disjoint you can't have both a zero and a one at the end so this forms a partition right so by the sum rule the size of s is going to be the size of s not plus the size of S1 which we just established is I guess I flip them around nus one choose K plus nus1 choose kus1 okay and as we established at the beginning this is also equal to and K okay does that make sense to everybody do people have any questions about uh either this Identity or uh combinatorial proofs yeah yeah the the question was is there any reason we uh didn't you know write out the definition of n k using the factorials simplify things uh because I'm a lazy folk and I don't want to um yeah so that that kind of depends on so the the the concern right was that this uh you know maybe this takes a lot longer than just uh you know putting your head down and going through all of the messy algebra um yeah at the beginning it it probably will right like uh if you are not familiar with this proof technique right it may not be obvious you know what set you should be counting or how you should be counting it uh but as you get practice right uh it could be much easier than you know just trying to to bruteforce it and uh I think in in uh uh possibly in recitation and homework you will see other identities where it may be less viable to you know actually you know go through the messy algeb right um so you know yeah this is kind of a silly example and it's one where you could definitely solve it in in other ways uh and in fact you know those of you who have seen this identity before I imagine you probably did prove it in other ways right uh but it's just kind of illustrative of of this particular proof technique does that does that answer your question okay uh any other questions comments concerns okay so as your colleague was hinting at earlier this kind of gives us the following so I imagine many of you have seen Pascal's triangle before but if you kind of just you know write out all of the binomial coefficients uh in like rows of a triangle so like this is uh n = 0 n = 1 Nal 2 Nal 3 and then you know successive uh entries in a row are going to be like n choose zero n choose one n choose 2 Etc okay so if you write all of these out right what we just proved is that every entry of this triangle right is the sum of the two entries above it right so if we take this four and this six here they sum to 10 okay that is uh that is essentially what this what this identity is saying okay uh so this is what we call you know Pascal's triangle um we also showed that the sum of all of the numbers in a single row is going to be a power of two right it's going to be uh 2 to the n like if we sum everything in row five we get 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 32 okay that was uh I think we proved it over there yeah top of the uh top of the rightmost board okay and um you will see uh I believe in homework that that if you sum the diagonals you get the Fibonacci numbers right so if you kind of uh let's see so go like that right if you Sum along these diagonals you get the Fibonacci numbers uh is am I correct is that still a homework problem or uh maybe sorry I've not actually looked at your homework uh full disclosure uh it's a fun exercise if you want to try it um but I will leave you with one more fun exercise prove that uh the sum from k equals 0 to n and choose K squared is going to be 2 N choose n okay so if you look at all of the entries of a row instead of just summing them up directly Square them and sum them up you get you know the entry that's kind of twice as far down in the middle okay so see if you can prove that using a uh a double counting proof uh so that's all we have time for today um if you have any questions comments concerns please feel free to come up um otherwise good luck on the exam um yeah
