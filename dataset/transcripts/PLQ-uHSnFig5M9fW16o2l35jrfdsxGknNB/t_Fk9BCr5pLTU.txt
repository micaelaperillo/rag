[Music] hey everyone I'm Harge tagger I'm one of the group Partners here at y Comin and today I'm going to talk about co-founders uh we're going to cover why do you even need a co-founder um when's the right time to bring on a co-founder and where can you find them let's start with talking about why should you have a co-founder at all I think there are three reasons the first building a successful startup is an incredibly hard thing to do and there is a huge amount of work to be done right like you're trying to take your idea make it a reality and compete with companies that have hundreds of employees and have been around for many many years and you really can't do that alone like you need someone else there who at a basic level can just get more work done with you right two people is more working hours per day than one but also having a good co-founder improves the quality of your work so if you have a co-founder with complimentary skill sets they can do things that you can't right if you have a co-founder um who's smart they can challenge your ideas they can talk you out of bad ones and help you find good ones that's why it's really important to have a a co-founder just so that you can get good high quality work done at the rate you need to be successful the second reason startups are a real emotional roller coaster you have moments where you think you're going to take over the world and moments where you're convinced you're about to die and having a great co-founding relationship can be a huge source of support in a way that no one else can right because your co-founder ideally should be someone who's all in on the startup in the same way that you are and when you're having bad moments they can bring you up and you can do the same for them and that's an important reason why you can't just of hire people or have people join your startup once it's already successful to get the the true benefits of co-founders you need someone who's all in and invested in the same way you are and the final reason is simply patent matching if you look at the most successful startups in history they all had co-founding teams and we don't always realize this because once a startup becomes successful it's common for some Founders to leave and one founder especially the CEO to become well-known uh famous and associate with the startup right if we go through some examples Facebook one of the biggest companies in the world is really now known as Mark Zuckerberg's company but he actually co-founded it with Dustin moskovitz if you think of Apple it's of course known as Steve Jobs company and very rightly so but Steve Jobs literally couldn't have built the first Apple computer if he didn't have Steve wnc as his co-founder so hopefully I've convinced you that you really want a co-founder to improve your odds of success if you want to start a startup but let's say you feel ready to go now uh and you really want to start the company but you don't have a great co-founder in mind yet should you start the company anyway or should you wait until you have a co-founder I think again in 90% of the cases you should really spend all of your efforts and trying to find a great co-founder to start a company with but I do think in 10% of the cases there's some exceptions I think the biggest exception is if you meet two conditions one you have a very specific idea you want to work on that you're very passionate about and you have some domain experience that makes you really uniquely qualified to work on that idea set another way if you have an idea that you have really high conviction about that solving a real problem because you've got some experience that makes you an expert on the problem and you're an engineer and you can start building it you can make progress without requiring a technal co-founder then I think it's fair for you to get going start the company build the first version of the product and bring a co-founder on as you start making some progress and traction if you're not an engineer I don't think you can do this and I think you should really focus your time on trying to find a great technical co-founder um to start the company with okay so let me give you an example of when YC combinator funded a single founder that worked out really well it was Drew hon the founder of Dropbox so Drew applied to YC as a single founder and he was actually initially rejected and told to go get a co-founder so he did bring on a co-founder a great co-founder a rash but Drew kept making progress on Dropbox anyway he would both both build the product again make progress on the MVP while also looking in the background for a co-founder and he found a great one so let's talk about what should you look for in a potential co-founder I'm going to start by giving you a bit of meta advice here the thing that's most important about your co-founder is that they can handle stress well because there's going to be lots of stress as you start and work on your startup journey and even if they have the perfect set of complimentary skills if they don't handle stress well or don't help each other handle stress well it's very unlikely your relationship is going to last the stress and rigors of founding a company and this is why failed co-founder relationships is really the number one reason we see startups fail here at wcom so how do you know if someone can handle stress well or not well the best way is to have worked with them under stress previously right counterintuitively this is one reason why often starting a company with a friend or a former work isn't always guaranteed to work out because maybe you never worked under real stress with your former colleague because you were both working at Google or a big company where there just wasn't like the same amount of stress as you have under under startup conditions or maybe you and your friends really enjoy hanging out socially and you have a great time together but you've never been in any intense stressful situations so if you've not been in a stressful situation with someone before you can never know for sure how they'll handle stress which means no co-founder relation relationship is a Surefire bet but you are definitely more likely um to survive and do well with someone you've already worked with and that you already know in some capacity than a total stranger the second thing when you're looking for a co-founder is make sure that they have the same high level goals in starting a company as you do right people have different motivations for wanting to start startups and the type of startup they want to start so let me give you an example if you really want to found a high press fast growing startup that raises multiple rounds of funding and can one day go public then you will not be a good co-founder fit for somebody who wants to grow slow and steady and build a lifestyle business that makes good amounts of Revenue and pays good salaries but doesn't come with a ton of pressure and expectations right that's just one example but there's all kinds of other ways we see co-founders who are indiv ually very skilled and have great complimentary skill sets still not work out which is they just had different reasons for starting a company and that eventually causes enough friction to really fracture that relationship so my advice would be before you start a company with someone talk about this stuff like ask them why they want to start a company ask them what success looks like for them um and try and get a good read on are you both aligned on why you're starting this company and what you want out of it my final advice would be don't overly focus on the specific set of skills your co-founder has today of course ideally you want a co-founder that has complimentary skills in particular if you're building a software or technology company there really should be at least one co-founder who's Technical and can program but let's say you have that don't overly fixate on which specific technical skills does that co-founder have it doesn't matter if they can only program in a certain language or if they've only got experience building iPhone app applications versus web applications Again The Meta skill you care about is is your co-founder smart and are they willing to learn new things and willing to adapt as your startup grows and changes um which means you care a lot more about their trajectory like how can they grow as your startup grows and can they acquire the skills they'll need more so than do they have a specific set of skills today so next let's talk about where can you find co-founders again my meta advice is you should ideally have a set of potential co-founders long before you actually plan on starting a startup and the way you do that is in the course of your life like when you're studying or when you're working is to kind of always be trying to find people to work on projects with together because working on projects whether they're weekend projects side projects just stuff purely for fun gives you a chance to get to know what someone's really like to work with are they motivated do they like are they good at the things that they say they're good at in an environment that's a little bit less pressurized than a startup right um I think one of maybe the edgiest pieces of advice I've heard on this uh at a Yom talk was from a Founder who said that in the sort of decade before they started their company they really used to think a lot about who are their friends who are the people they were closest to and spending the most time with and how many of those people would they start a company with Someday I'm not saying this is a right advice for everybody but just to give you one uh extreme end of the Spectrum it would be to like always be scanning for people you might start a company with someday and making sure you're spending time with them now let's say you want to start a company now like you you are ready um how do you do that where do you find potential co-founders again the advice is obvious it's people you already know but the number one blocker I see to why people say they're having a hard time finding a co-founder is that they already assume that everybody they know is not available like a common excuse I hear is oh yeah like I know know lots of people who would be a great potential co-founder but they're not ready to start a startup right now or they just got a job at Google or Facebook and they will never leave and my number one bit of advice to them is you can never make any assumptions about who's available you have to always make the ask and you have to get in the habit of asking people hey like I want to start a company would you join me I think you'd make a great co-founder I think we'd make a great co-founding team here's one uh tactic I also give people which is once you made the ask if that person really says that they're not available is ask them who would they pick to be their co-founder if they were starting a company and ask for an introduction to that person right so go and meet that person and get to know them but this sort of like branching out of your network is a good algorithm for finding more potential co-founders who aren't in your immediate Network another way to find more co-founders if you need to grow your surface area um is to just start doing things like in particular uh if you're a technical or if you're an engineer work on some open source projects attend hackathons attend developer meetups in your area those are great sources of finding other people who like doing and Building Things who might be open to quitting their job or dropping out of grad school to work on a startup with you another specific place to find potential co-founders is the YC co-founder matching platform so we've made it easy for people who are trying to find co-founders to upload their profiles and find other people that might want to start a company with them now I'm me give you my honest take we started the YC co-founder matching platform because we want to increase the number of startups that exist in the world and part of that is helping more people find great co-founders but there is a particular formula that works well for finding somebody on a co-founder matching platform even why combinators and that is to try and find people who you have things in common with who are the kinds of people that there's a good chance you would have ended up meeting at some point anyway okay so let me give you some of a couple of examples to give you a sense of what I I really mean by that a good example of teams we see from the YC co-founder matching platform are teams that we could describe as two co-founders who would probably have eventually met each other anyway it just happened to be on the co-founder matching platform and that's teams where you know it's people who both studied computer science um roughly the same age like they work on projects and seem to have like similar flavors to them their interests overlap like that's the kind of team we feel like ah like that's probably the kind of team that would have eventually found each other anyway the kinds of teams we don't get so excited about are where the co-founders would never have met each other in sort of any conceivable Universe it's where there's a huge age difference or they don't have any sort of mutual interest or they just doesn't seem like those are the types of Founders that would have anything in common if they hadn't found each other on a co-founder matching platform so once you found a potential co-founder how do you go about getting started working together well if you already know each other well you're already friends former colleagues then I think you just get going like you decide what to work on um you start building a prototype you can apply to Y comor there's lots of great advice out there for how do you get a startup going once you have your co-founder if you don't know know your co-founder very well already which again is not optimal um but my advice would be to just test it out for a bit like can you spend some evenings and weekends working together and trying out small projects like really this is not that different from deciding who to marry you want to have like a little bit of a daing period where you kind of just get to know each other and have conversations of the type I mentioned before about you know why do you want to start a company what are your goals from this um and have a period of trying that out before you really Jump and Go Allin uh on being co-founders okay so once you've decided to go Allin and start a company with somebody you'll go through some logistical steps like you're incorporating the company and you initial each other shares you will have to decide on what the equity split will be and my default advice here would be you should split the equity equally between yourselves and the reason is if this startup is successful you will end up working on it for the next 10 years or more and so even if someone's been thinking about the idea for a little bit longer now or done a little bit more work that will really be quite insignificant over the long term of the startups life and so it's better that you both start from a equal co-founding Equity split so you're both equally invested and you both feel like you have real equal ownership over the company and want to give it your role so while everyone does their best to make sure their co-founding relationship works unfortunately they don't always and as I mentioned before for the number one reason startups fail at y com is the co-founders break up so what are some of the most common reasons for that happening I would say like the number one core reason is the co-founders didn't respect each other or they grew to not respect each other and specifically what I've seen is it's very common for co-founders to have different roles and responsibilities a common split is one co-founder is responsible for sales and getting customers and the other co-founder is responsible for product and building the technology and that's a very clear uh delineation of responsibilities which is great but problems will creep in if the sales co-founder feels that the technical co-founder is not building the product quickly or well enough and or the technical co-founder feels the sales co-founder is not selling the product well enough if that respect breaks down and one co-founder feels they could do the other co-founder's job better than them uh it's very hard to recover from that and that's usually the single most common reason we see startups break up the second reason which is similar but subtly different is when both or all co-founders want to be the CEO the actual titles you give yourselves at the early stages of a startup don't really matter that much because they don't really change the work that you do on a day-to-day basis but there is something symbolic about the CEO title and what it says is that this is the person that's trusted to make have the final call on really hard decisions and even if people don't agree with them in the moment everybody agrees to disagree and rally behind the CEO like the CEO is really the sort of true leader of the startup it's bad when there are multiple people who want to be the CEO because it's basically saying I'm the person that should really be in charge of this place and I don't trust and respect the other co-founders to have that the third reason that co-founder relationships often break up it's really kind of maybe arguably similar to not having shared goals or values but a specific instance of it which is having very different work ethic expectations startups are very hard and all consuming um there's no one to tell you which hours you should work or how much you should get done in a day it's all up to you to Define how much you're working what you're working on how you build the company and if you and your co-founder have very different work ethic expectations one of you wants to be working all the time like eat work sleep but you know the other co-founder wants to have more work life balance or just feels differently about how they should be judged um and what their expectations are those relationships get very very strained under the stress and pressure of a startup and we don't see those typically work out so well so again have these conversations early on and set expectations up front to be sure that your co-founder is on the same page as you are so how do you avoid getting into a co-founder breakup well to some extent it's unavoidable this happens and the best lesson you can take is learn from the experience and move on and don't repeat the same mistake with your next startup but having dealt with hundreds of co-founder relationships and breakups over the years one piece of advice I do give is don't avoid disagreements like anytime you disagree about something have the conversation don't delay hard conversations like it's very easy for co-founders or people to just shortterm about this and what I mean is you feel like oh like okay we're disagreeing or I'm upset about something but I don't want to rock the boat like we've got so much work to do I don't want to bring this up right now I'll bring it up next week or I'll bring it up next month or you always procrastinate and you delay on having a hard conversation and really I think what that does it's like death by a Thousand Cuts like it just means that pressure just builds up and it builds up and it builds up and then when you do eventually spill over and say something you're now so heated that it's it's not possible to have a calm conversation where you work things out it becomes very emotional um and confrontational and that really damages the relationship and so my tactical advice on this would be set up regular one-on ones with your co-founder and that may sound a little formal but something I did with my startups is I would just put time on the calendar at the end of every month where we would just go for a drink or a meal and just talk about how we would doing like we were just check in and like do we think things are going well are we excited like how are like the two of us uh working together and if you put that on the calendar and commit to it it gives you a opportunity to regularly release some of the pressure that every startup co-founder relationship has slowly over time rather than having it all build up and come out in one big burst so I hopefully I've convinced you of a few things one that you really should get a co-founder if you want to start a company because it's just incredibly hard to be successful with that one two that you should ideally start a company with somebody you already know like somebody you have a sense of what their skills are and how they cope with stress and three even if you have a great co-founder relationship you will still have to work hard to maintain that relationship um and avoid it getting stressed and fractured over time by having difficult conversations regularly I really hope you find a great co-founder best of luck with the search and I hope to see you at yon someday [Music] n
