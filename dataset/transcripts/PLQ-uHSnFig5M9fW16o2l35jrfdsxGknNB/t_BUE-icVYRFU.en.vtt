foreign [Music]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.700
I'm Hodge tiger one of the group Partners at y&nbsp;
combinator today I'm going to talk about whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.680
you should start a startup because YC invests&nbsp;
in startups so early I've spent a lot of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460
with people who aren't yet sure if they should&nbsp;
start a company or not I've helped many people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.900
including my own friends and family think about&nbsp;
this decision at my intended audience for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.520
talk is anyone who doesn't feel ready to start&nbsp;
a startup today but thinks they may want to one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.360
day in the future I'm going to break down the&nbsp;
topic of whether you should start a startup into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.400
two parts first we'll talk about which types of&nbsp;
people seem best suited to being startup Founders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.840
and help you figure out if you might be one of&nbsp;
them second we'll talk about how you might best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.280
prepare yourself for becoming a startup founder&nbsp;
in the future let's start by helping you figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
out if you're the kind of person who should become&nbsp;
a startup founder or not I really wish there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.200
simple test you could take that would give you a&nbsp;
clear and correct answer to that question I've now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.000
worked with almost a thousand startup Founders as&nbsp;
a group partner at YC and I still get surprised by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.800
which people take to Startup life like a duck&nbsp;
to water and which ones struggle to adapt now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.180
you might find this surprising if your image of&nbsp;
startups is based on the way famous Founders are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.860
often depicted in books or movies these depictions&nbsp;
can make it seem that if you're not a ruthless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.420
brilliant programmer like Mark Zuckerberg in The&nbsp;
Social Network movie or a charismatic product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.580
genius like Steve Jobs in one of the many books or&nbsp;
movies about him you probably aren't cut out to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.400
a startup founder now I can't deny it that being&nbsp;
a brilliant programmer or a charismatic product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.860
genius will certainly make it easier to be a&nbsp;
successful startup founder but I can say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.540
after working with many successful Founders&nbsp;
there are many more different types of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.180
who succeed as startups with different strengths&nbsp;
than just those stereotypes as an investor my job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.220
is to pick which people will make great startup&nbsp;
Founders and yet even after 15 years of starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.080
and investing in startups I still get surprised&nbsp;
by who turns out to be a great startup founder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.520
that means it's going to be hard for you to know&nbsp;
for sure if you're suited to being one you might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
think you could just look at how well someone has&nbsp;
done in school or at work and assume success there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.880
will lead to success of startups that's definitely&nbsp;
what I thought when I first started working at YC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.920
in 2010 and began reading YC funding applications&nbsp;
for the first time after I started working with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.940
more startups though I realized that these signals&nbsp;
mattered much less than I'd expected they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.980
when you're working on a startup you have to&nbsp;
put in Blood Sweat and Tears to convince even a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.900
single user to care about trying your product let&nbsp;
alone convincing the first 10 or 100 you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.760
push through a lot of rejection to get there and&nbsp;
because this is your startup all of that rejection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.980
feels very personal in a way it doesn't when&nbsp;
you're working at a Fan Company building a product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.300
for someone else it takes a lot of resilience&nbsp;
to make it through this initial struggle to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.640
your early users and that's the quality I think&nbsp;
is most important for startup Founders to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.460
resilient people are suited to startups and should&nbsp;
definitely become Founders but how do you know if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.260
you have enough resilience to be a startup founder&nbsp;
when I first started working at yce I thought I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.540
could use confidence as a proxy for resilience I'd&nbsp;
assume that if someone projected confidence like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
speaking with conviction being high energy during&nbsp;
our funding interviews they were likely to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.400
resilient founder the more Founders I worked with&nbsp;
though the more I realized this was also wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.100
it turned out that someone could appear very&nbsp;
confident initially but not be resilient when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.740
their startup hit roadblocks conversely some of&nbsp;
the quietest and least confident seeming Founders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.840
at first turned out to be the most resilient&nbsp;
Founders I'd go on to work with many eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.420
taking their companies public this is Saji the&nbsp;
founder of benchlink I met him when we funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.360
benjling in 2012. benjling is now worth over&nbsp;
six billion dollars and Sagi has grown into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.120
a formidable founder and CEO but I remember when&nbsp;
we first interviewed him and his co-founder Corey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.700
they were both softly spoken engineers and we&nbsp;
were all concerned they wouldn't be suited to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.880
working on benchling because benchling's idea&nbsp;
was to sell software to biotech companies and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.100
pharmaceutical companies to make money and we&nbsp;
weren't sure that they would be good at that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.680
kind of Enterprise sales this concern was&nbsp;
shared by investors at demoday who worried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.420
that they wouldn't be able to get those biotech or&nbsp;
pharmaceutical companies to pay for the benchling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.780
software and benjling struggled to raise very&nbsp;
much seed funding at demoday sales did turn out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.080
to be a real struggle for benchlink in fact over a&nbsp;
year after they'd graduated from YC benchling was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.280
still not making any Revenue though they did&nbsp;
have some enthusiastic grad students as free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.760
users and the product continued getting better&nbsp;
it took them almost another year that's now two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.000
years after ycee to start doing sales and making&nbsp;
any Revenue now benchling is on calls to become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.920
a public company someday and has many of the&nbsp;
world's top biotech and pharmaceutical companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.220
as customers looking back I always had confidence&nbsp;
that Sagi was a good engineer but I could not have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.100
predicted back when we funded him in 2012 that he&nbsp;
would have the resilience to overcome that amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.740
of rejection and transform himself into the leader&nbsp;
of a company that took many years to become great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.180
at Enterprise sales but what I haven't shared&nbsp;
with you are the stories of many other Founders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.040
who seemed equally talented at first when we&nbsp;
first funded their companies but turned out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.720
not to have the same amount of resilience as these&nbsp;
Founders did I've thought a lot about how to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.400
the difference between people who have this kind&nbsp;
of startup resilience and those who don't I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.380
wondered if maybe having the right motivations or&nbsp;
reasons to start a company mean you're more likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.440
to have this special resilience over time though&nbsp;
I've decided that this also doesn't matter as much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.140
as I had thought I think there are many perfectly&nbsp;
legitimate motivations to start a company for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.460
example it's become popular to say that you&nbsp;
shouldn't start a company just to make money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.860
that's considered a somewhat flimsy motivation but&nbsp;
I actually think it's fine to start a startup to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.120
become rich startups are one of the few ways&nbsp;
to make life-changing amounts of money in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.980
relatively short period of time if the desire to&nbsp;
make money gets you started then great go for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.160
I also think that simply being curious about&nbsp;
what it's like to found a startup is a fine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.100
initial motivation to start one actually doing&nbsp;
a startup is the only way to know for sure if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.900
you'll enjoy it the reason I have conviction&nbsp;
that your initial motivations don't matter so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.940
much is that I've seen motivation to change over&nbsp;
time I've seen Founders who started out a company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.040
with a plan to sell it within a year change&nbsp;
their mind as they kept working the company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.540
and they're still working on that same startup&nbsp;
a decade later and it's now a public company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.560
this means that your initial motivations to&nbsp;
start a startup aren't as important as what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.340
those motivations might change into over time in&nbsp;
order to keep working on a startup and keep going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.740
through those dark periods that every startup&nbsp;
experience is you need enduring motivations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.900
and I think the best ones are to be genuinely&nbsp;
interested in the problem you're working on and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.700
love the people you're working with we'll talk&nbsp;
more about finding those later so instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.320
introspecting too much on if you'll make a good&nbsp;
startup founder I'll offer some practical advice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.260
if you are curious about what it'd be like to&nbsp;
start a company start by asking yourself what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.900
do I have to lose now I mean this question not&nbsp;
as a rhetorical one but as a very practical one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.480
figure out what the worst case scenario looks&nbsp;
like if you started a startup and decide if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.740
you can live with that it's probably going to&nbsp;
take at least a year for you to have enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.180
data to tell if the startup you're working&nbsp;
on is promising enough to keep working on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:42.780
in the worst case you'll shut down the company&nbsp;
without having earned much or any salary for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.240
that year can you live without worst case&nbsp;
the calculus here is different for everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.540
if you're about to graduate college taking a year&nbsp;
after graduating to work on a startup is not a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:00.000
deal those job offers will still be waiting for&nbsp;
you in a year but if you've been a Fang employee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.040
for the past nine years and you're in line for a&nbsp;
big promotion this year then maybe you stand to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.080
lose a lot by spending the next year working on a&nbsp;
startup instead asking yourself if you can handle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.780
the worst case is the best way to know if you&nbsp;
should start a startup be honest with yourself if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:21.180
you can't actually handle the worst case then your&nbsp;
own constant anxiety will probably self-sabotage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.440
your startup efforts when you're thinking about&nbsp;
the worst case scenario of working on a startup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.080
you should Factor something else into the equation&nbsp;
you will learn a lot from starting a company I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.920
don't think enough people factor in how valuable&nbsp;
this learning is when they're doing their worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.200
case scenario analysis as a startup founder you're&nbsp;
responsible for making everything happen and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.220
means you get to do lots of different types&nbsp;
of work you'll have to do some amount of sales&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:50.340
product and customer support all at once this can&nbsp;
be very clarifying in helping you figure out what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.260
type of work you enjoy and where you might want to&nbsp;
focus your career even if the startup doesn't work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.940
out some people start a company that doesn't work&nbsp;
and then they jump straight back into starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.620
another one because they want to learn from their&nbsp;
mistakes others decide they actually really enjoy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.900
specializing in doing one thing really well and&nbsp;
they join a company where they can do just that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.700
the startup experience can really improve your&nbsp;
career opportunities even if the startup doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:21.000
succeed my second startup triple bite use software&nbsp;
to help companies identify and hire great people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.040
I work with hundreds of employers as they search&nbsp;
for the best talent and I found that many of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.600
were explicitly looking to hire people who&nbsp;
had previous startup experience they believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.860
they showed evidence of being a self-starter and&nbsp;
being able to take initiative and Lead projects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.140
some of the most successful YC companies have&nbsp;
actually built their hiring processes around this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.380
knowledge Rippling a 10 billion dollar company&nbsp;
founded by Parker Conrad also a YC company hires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.420
former Founders and puts them in charge of entire&nbsp;
product divisions usually we love hiring former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.820
Founders to run specific product lines and and&nbsp;
build them and and really run them as general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.700
managers we've been you know really successful at&nbsp;
recruiting I think we have Lao now probably around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.640
50 former Founders that work at rip Lane at YC&nbsp;
we often see startup Founders leave this thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.220
up if it doesn't work out and go on to join a&nbsp;
more successful YC company this is Nick Grandy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:21.000
YC funded his first startup wonderbar in 2008.&nbsp;
that startup shut down but he went on to join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
another YC company you may have heard of Airbnb&nbsp;
as his first employee that of course worked out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.940
great and after many years at Airbnb he left&nbsp;
to start another YC company out school which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:38.880
is now valued at over 3 billion I share these&nbsp;
stories to show how career progressions are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.460
not always perfectly linear introducing some&nbsp;
Serendipity and meeting smart ambitious people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.440
can completely transform your career and being&nbsp;
a startup founder is a great way to do exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.320
that okay so let's say you do decide you can&nbsp;
live with the worst case of doing a startup but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.240
you're not ready to do one right now how can you&nbsp;
best prepare yourself to start one in the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.600
to actually start a company you'll want two things&nbsp;
an idea and a co-founder now sometimes an idea and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.820
co-founder both come to you quickly and you're Off&nbsp;
to the Races there's lots of great startup content&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.800
out there about how to start a company once you're&nbsp;
ready but let's talk about what to do if it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.320
take you some time to get to that point I'd start&nbsp;
by encouraging you to not think of finding ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.220
and co-founders as two separate tasks it's hard&nbsp;
to think up good ideas yourself also your ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.140
will start out being vague and fuzzy more like&nbsp;
a hunch or an Impulse than a clearly formed idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.240
and you'll go through seven iterations of fleshing&nbsp;
it out into something more tangible and concrete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.840
having someone to talk through that initial&nbsp;
idea or impulse with and debate and discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.660
is important and the best person to do that with&nbsp;
is your co-founder I find my best ideas come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.640
me during conversations with smart people so I'd&nbsp;
start by thinking about who do you know that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.200
enjoy talking about ideas with in college these&nbsp;
are often the people you'll go to when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.460
stuck on a hard problem or they are the people&nbsp;
you most enjoy working on group assignments with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.500
at work these are the colleagues who you find&nbsp;
make you the most productive and help you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.960
your best work I'd see these people out and start&nbsp;
having conversations with them about ideas or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.280
technologies that you find interesting talk about&nbsp;
products you use every day that you admire or are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.880
frustrated by talk about Technologies&nbsp;
you think are underrated today and why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:29.520
flesh your thoughts out and debate them spend&nbsp;
the time between these conversations doing your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.140
own reading and research to learn more about the&nbsp;
topics you find interesting if you're a curious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.640
person this will seem natural to you anyway all&nbsp;
of this primes your mind to more easily notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.800
and think of potential startup ideas and it helps&nbsp;
you get to know your friends or colleagues better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.900
as potential co-founders if you're struggling to&nbsp;
think of people you enjoy talking about ideas with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.640
then you probably need to change your environment&nbsp;
and meet some new people if you really want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.080
start a company one day it's best to choose an&nbsp;
environment where you will be around many people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.120
who might someday be your co-founder I think the&nbsp;
best environment for this is working at a startup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.580
you both get to see how a startup works from&nbsp;
the inside and your colleagues will be less&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.320
risk-averse than the average Fang employee so&nbsp;
if you're in college I'd recommend finding a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.840
startup to work at after graduation or if you had&nbsp;
a fan company now think about leaving to join a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.700
startup as an intermediate step to starting your&nbsp;
own someday once you're around smart people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.440
you enjoy talking about ideas with I'd recommend&nbsp;
you start experimenting with turning these ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.780
into side projects at some point during these&nbsp;
conversations you'll eventually say something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.540
like huh like it'd be cool if someone built X and&nbsp;
that's the moment to stop and think about how you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.640
could be the one to build X is there a simple&nbsp;
first version you could build over a weekend or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.260
can you find other people who might be users and&nbsp;
Pitch them on the idea to see how they react keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.180
pulling on this thread until you've come up with a&nbsp;
plan to turn this idea into something real however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.460
small it is right now you're not trying to launch&nbsp;
the next unicorn you're just getting used to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.680
experience of turning ideas into reality and&nbsp;
experiencing the thrill of launching something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.120
turn your idea into something real you'll&nbsp;
need the skills to actually build them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:15.660
if you're not a programmer then either you need&nbsp;
to learn how to program or find a co-founder who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.300
is a programmer my advice speaking from experience&nbsp;
is someone who started his first startup without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.360
being able to code you start learning to code you&nbsp;
only need to learn enough to build a version one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.680
of your ideas once you're around smart people&nbsp;
and you're working on some side projects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.880
how do you know when it's time to take the leap&nbsp;
and quit your job to start a company while it'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.900
be great if one of your side projects started&nbsp;
getting explosive traction and made the decision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.400
easy for you you can't rely on that happening if&nbsp;
you're serious about starting a company someday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.460
even if you launch your side projects and get some&nbsp;
early users the feedback you get will be mixed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.340
it's not uncommon for the early use of any product&nbsp;
to span the spectrum of being delighted appalled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:01.800
and indifferent towards a product to judge how&nbsp;
promising your side project is as a startup idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:08.040
I'd use some advice from my y combinator partner&nbsp;
Paul bukhai he says that it is better to make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.920
product that a few people really love than one a&nbsp;
lot of people are indifferent Awards if your side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.560
project elicits a deep reaction from someone the&nbsp;
kind where they can legitimately say that doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.960
something very differently as a result of your&nbsp;
product existing then you may be onto something a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.060
single passionate user of a crude prototype that&nbsp;
was hacked together in a weekend means so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.980
more than a million sign-ups on a waitlist for&nbsp;
something that doesn't exist yet my main advice to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.540
you would be to think less about how well your&nbsp;
side projects are going and think more about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.700
how much you enjoying the process of thinking up&nbsp;
ideas and turning them into something real are you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:50.160
learning new things and finding yourself energized&nbsp;
contrast this feeling with your day job if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.880
find your job is draining but you have energy&nbsp;
to work on your side projects on evenings and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:59.340
weekends that's a sign it may be time to quit and&nbsp;
work on your own ideas pay particular attention to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.380
how much you enjoy working with your side project&nbsp;
collaborators if you enjoy working with them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:10.140
you both want to be startup Founders recognize how&nbsp;
rare that is having a great co-founder who wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:18.240
to do a startup is a fantastic reason to quit and&nbsp;
start one to finish my advice is one don't worry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.940
too much about your initial motivations or reasons&nbsp;
to start a company those can change over time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:30.060
simply being curious about the experience&nbsp;
of starting a startup is enough to get going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.520
think about the worst case scenario if you did&nbsp;
start a company and be sure you can live with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.820
if you don't yet have an idea or co-founder start&nbsp;
looking around for smart people to talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:47.700
ideas with and launch some side projects&nbsp;
with actually launch those side projects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:53.940
however small to get the experience of turning&nbsp;
ideas into reality and if you find someone you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.320
really enjoy working with side projects with and&nbsp;
you both want to start a company make the jump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.180
I really hope you do and I hope we get to work&nbsp;
together at YC Community someday thanks so much

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.545
