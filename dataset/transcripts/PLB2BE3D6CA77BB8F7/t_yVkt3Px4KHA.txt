So let's start with probability. Let's look at a probability of a binary variable. What do you mean by a binary binary variable? It can take only two outcomes. So it can take only two values. Uh for example, it could be 0 one head or tail on or off. Okay. So we call we we are going to call this variable a for instance. So a could be either h or a is equal to 10. But that could happen that event could happen with a certain probability. So that by that I mean the probability is like way of expressing the belief that the particular event could happen. So we could assign a value to that that is the probability of A taking value H. Okay fine. So here the values of A and B sorry. So here the value of A can be either H or T which means it has only two possible outcomes. That's why we call it binary variable. However, P of A is equal to H can lie anywhere from zero and one including zero and one. They don't have to be even. Sorry, they don't have to be even. Sorry, I didn't get your question. binary probability. Uh okay, we'll we'll look at that later. Like this particular event can take a particular probability and we'll we'll look at that particular case later. But in general, a probability will always lie between 0 and one. So and it can take any value between 0 and one. So it's a the range it can take is continuous. It's not discrete. Okay. However, the variable the value the variable can take is going to be discrete. It can take only a h sorry ho t. Okay. So that's why we call it binary variable. For example, take a deck of cards here. The value could be for example if you consider only one particular suit then it can be any one of those 13 values right so there this variable is not binary however the probability of particular event happening is always between 0 and one now let's look at some probability theory like like what like what you asked earlier is like whether they would be equal whether the head the probability of head and tail uh can be equal. Okay. So let's represent the probability a of h. This can be between 0 and one. What is the probability of a not happening? So we call it by a bar. Can you given p of a can you give me p of a bar? 1 - 1 - P of A. Okay. If there are two events happening, for example, you are throwing two coins, then we can consider their joint probabilities. Okay. So, let's say we have a coin A and there's a coin B. So, this coin can take two values as well as this coin can take another two values. Sorry. Okay. We know this a can take H with probability say assume it's unbiased. So it will be half. All these are going to be half. What's the probability of HT? Okay, so now we are considering a joint event. P of A is equal to H and P of B is equal to T. Okay. So in probability we represent it by something like this. PA. Do you know what is the PA intersection B? You want both events to happen. There will be P of A and in this case it's P of B. So we could s simply say it's 1/4. Why this is possible? It's because these two events are independent. The coin A getting a head doesn't affect coin B getting a tail. So it doesn't have any influence. That's why these two events are independent. The dependent events are bit complex to analyze. Let's skip them at the moment. So we can we know like all these probabilities are going to be 1/4. So we looked at a particular uh condition here that is a taking head and b taking tail. What about what about the condition? What about the case where either A or B takes a head? How can we represent that? So it would be something like a is equal to a b= at or probably at least one so that by that I can also represent something like this. Okay. Yeah this is sufficient anyway. So what are the possible events? Okay, so these three events could give rise to this probability. It's better if you can represent this in a diagram. So let's go and represent this in a diagram. This is A and this is B getting say head. In one case both can take head. That is this particular condition intersection we earlier looked at. So what is this whole thing? There is either A gets H or B gets H which is this condition. We call it P A union B. Okay. Is there an efficient way of finding this rather than writing down all possible cases? Is there an efficient way of finding P A union B from high school maths probably? No idea. Okay. PA A union B is equal to P A plus P B minus P A intersection B because if you consider PA A you would have taken this full circle when you take PB you would have taken this full circle so which means you're counting this area twice so you have to deduct it once okay great is the basics of the probability. Now actually we looked at two events, two joint events here. Uh but we should have a a formal way of looking at multiple events. So how can we do that? The first way is doing it by trees. Let's say we represent the first the outcome of the first trial by a branch. We can represent the outcome of the second trial by another branch from these two previous branches. So this would be HTT H sorry TH TT okay and we know this could happen with probability half so we know it's again half half so this is 1/4 fourth. Okay. Okay. Suppose we want to do this for an outcome of uh of throwing uh uh dice then probably we could we would have six branches here. Okay. Which again uh fks into another 36 branches. So there's there should be another easier way for that. We could use a second method called grid. We could simply put that in a diagram. Okay. So this is the first trial and this will be our second trial. Okay. So now we can represent any possible outcome on this grid. For example, can you give me an example where you throw the same number uh in both the trials? Then uh what would be the layout of it in this grid throwing the same number in both the trials because this is the first trial this second trial then it would be the diagram right? If you want to calculate the probability, we know the probability is the ratio between the possible outcome sorry the ratio between the outcomes we expect over the all possible outcomes. So here we know there will be six instances in this uh in this highlighted area compared to 36 total possibilities. So it'll be simply 6x 36. Okay. How can you find the probability of getting a cumulative total of six? Then again it'll be very simple. It could be 1 5 2 4 3 3 4 4 2 1 5 right so it'll be 5 by okay so either by using trees or grid you can easily find the probabilities okay now like let's look at few Concrete examples let's say suppose we are throwing three coins then what is the probability of one particular outcome in that trial in all three trials. What is the probability? So assuming that these are unbiased coins, what is the probability of one particular outcome? Because how many possible outcomes are there? If you're drawing three coins, consider this tree. First it splits into two, then it splits into four, then eight. Right? Okay. So there are eight possible outcomes. So each outcome will have the probability 18. So what is the probability of head appearing exactly twice? How can you do that? Of course, you can write the tree and count. What is the easier way of doing that? Since we know this count, since we know this probability of particularly event happening, how can we come up with the probability of getting exactly two heads? It could be head, head or tail. So this is by enumerating all possible outcomes. So it could have been head tail where we put the tail only at the end. It could have been head tail head or it could have been tail head. Okay, in these three cases you're getting only you're getting exactly two heads. So we are enumerating all possible outcomes and we know each possible outcome would take the probability of 18. So the total probability here is 308. Okay. So this is one way of handling a probability question. Okay, you can do that only because these are independent events and you can sum them. Okay, we'll come to that later. Um suppose we are rolling two foursided dice and assuming they are fair. How many possible outcomes are there? Two foursided dice. And assuming that each of them are fair, that means unbiased. How many possible outcomes are there? Consider this tree. First, it branches into four. Okay, in the first trial, there are it's a four-sided dice, so there are four possible outcomes. So, it branches into four. Okay, then each branch will in turn fork into another four branches. So there are totally 16 outcomes. Okay, so what is the probability of rolling a two and a three? What is the probability of rolling a two and a three? Not in the particular, not in the given order. Not in the given order. Can anyone give the answer? Okay, let's say so we have to roll a two and a three. So which means it could have been 2 three or 3 2 and we know the probability of each event is 116th. So it will be this will be 116th and this will be 116th. So the total probability is 1/8. Okay. What is the probability of uh getting the sum of the rows a odd number? What is the probability of getting an odd number as a sum of the rows? Now this is getting a bit tricky because now it's it might be a bit harder to enumerate all possible cases. So how can we do that? There should be a shortcut or even sorry odd or even it it can be either odd or even right so it would be half. Okay, this is another trick we might be able to use to get the answers quickly. What is the probability of the first ro being equal to the second row? In the same line you can think what is the probability of getting the first row equal to the second row. It's quite similar to this. Any ideas? It's a four-sided dice. There are four possible outcomes. This is one case where it could be 1 one or it could be 2 or 3 or 4. And if it's like nsided dice, it will be n right. So if it's nsided dice, there are n possible n uh outcomes desired and there are totally n byn outcomes, right? So we get 10 n probability. What is the probability of rolling uh what is the probability of at least one roll equal to four? At least one roll equal to four. This is very interesting. These type of questions you'll get in the pet sets and all probably in quiz too. What is the probability of getting at least one role equal to four? Okay. So, what are the possible outcomes? First role could be a four and the second role could be anything, right? Or it could be four and the first row could have been anything or both could have been four but we would have considered that that here as well. Okay. So what we have to do is we have to calculate this probability and this probability add them and deduct this because this would have been double counted it's quite like this this intersection we want to remove that and we want to find the junior okay so what is this probability since we don't care about the second role we have to care only about the first role where first role getting four which is 1/4 and this is 1/4 4. Similarly, and this is 1/4 by 1/4. So, 16th. So, it'll be half - 1 / 16. And when you give out when you give the answers, if it's hard, you can just leave it like this. So, this is what we call giving the answers as formula instead of giving exact fractions because sometimes it might be hard to find the fraction. Suppose it's something like 1 / say 2 ^ 5 into 3 ^2 something like this or say 5 you're not supposed to like give the exact value in the decimal even the fractions you can give such formulas you can give something like this too to give the inverse probability of that not happening. Okay, let's see. Let's move into a little bit more complicated example. Uh, a pack of cards. What is the probability of getting an ace? Anyone? One out of two. I didn't. Yes. just is. Huh? 4 over 52. Yes. Okay. Or if you consider one suit, it would have been like one over 13, right? You could have considered one suit and out of like Okay. It's the same same analysis, right? Okay. What is the probability of getting a specific card which means say ace of hearts? It's what she said. Yeah. 1 over 52. What is the probability of not getting an AS? Sorry, one over 30. Okay. Okay. This is where we make use of the inverse probability. Okay. So that will come into play very often. Okay. Now let's get into two deck of playing cards. Okay. What is the sample size? Sorry. What is the sample size of drawing cards from two deck of cards? Two cards actually. We're going to draw two cards from two different decks. Sorry. Okay. What is the probability? What is the sample size of drawing a card from one deck? there are 52 possible outcomes. So there are not for each outcome here we have 52 outcomes there right? So it's 52 x 52. It's like the tree but here we have 52 branches. Okay. So eventually you'll have 52 x 52. This is where you can't enumerate all possible cases. So you should have a way to u find the final probability. Okay. Okay. So in this case what is the probability of getting at least one is what is the probability of getting at least one is this is again similar to this case remember this diagram it's called v diagram remember this so what is the probability of getting at least one s which means it could have You could have got the S from the first deck or the second deck or both. But if you're getting from both, you have to deduct it because otherwise you would have doubt you would have double counted it. Okay. So it is getting the getting an as from the first deck is 1 / 13. Second deck 1 over 13. Getting from from both is 1 over 52 by 52. Sorry. 1 / 13 by 1 over 13 you. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, that's what I explained earlier. You are drawing two. You're doing two trials. You could have got the as from here and this could have been anything. You could have got as from here and this could have been anything. You could have as from both. Okay. So you should add these two probabilities because we need a case where at least one card is. Okay. But the problem is this could have happened here and here. That's why we deduct it. What is the probability of getting neither card? What is the probability of neither card being an as one minus this? Okay. Exactly. So it's okay. You're getting comfortable with the inverse probability. Now what's the probability of two cards from the same suit? What is the probability of getting two cards from the same suit? Now it's getting interesting. Two cards from the same suit. So how can we think about this? Of course you can enumerate all possible cases and count. We don't want to do that. Okay. We're going to use the grid here to visualize this. Okay, it could have been a spades or hearts or clubs or diamond. Okay, so we want two cards are the same suit, right? So it's one sorry four over 16 possible outcomes. You see that? So see we are using all the tools available at our disposal. Trees, grids, counting, uh vend diagrams, inverse probability. Yeah, you should be able to do that to get the answers quickly because you could have actually done you could have done something like this too, but it would take more time, right? So, this would be a simpler uh way of visualizing things. Okay. What is the probability of getting neither card a diamond nor club? Neither card is diamond nor club. That is tricky. But since we have this grade, we can easily visualize that. Okay. So if neither card is diamond nor club, then it could have been only these two values, right? Which is again 4 16. So there are four possible cases. Okay. Okay. So, what is what is the summary? What is the take-home message here in probability? uh the probability of the belief or the way of expressing the belief of or like how many of of a particular event happening. Okay. Now there could be several possible outcomes. Out of those possible outcomes you have certain number of desired outcomes. How can you how can you find that? You can either enumerate all of them. You can put them in tree or you can put them in a grid or you can use some sort of vend diagram and like come up come up with some sort of analysis. Okay, here we start with our belief that the coin is unbiased or we have a fair chance of throwing any card from the pack of cards. So like we have uh like all these unbiased beliefs or sorry beliefs about the characteristics of each trial. Okay. So we start from that. then we we find the probability of a particular event happening in certain number of trials. But what if we don't have the knowledge about the coin? What if we don't know whether it's fair or not? What if we don't know P of A is equal to H is equal to half? Suppose we don't know that. Suppose it's only P. How can we find that? Okay, what you could do is you could simulate this. You can throw coins several times and count the total number of heads you get. Okay, so it could be n of heads over n trial will give you the p, right? Okay, this is a way of finding the probabilities through certain number of trials. It's like simulating the uh experiments. It's called Monte Carlo simulation and using that we try to find a particular parameter of the model. You know like how they actually found the value of pi at the beginning pi It's again using a multiolor simulation. What you could do is for a given uh radius you can actually check whether it lies within a circle or not. You can simulate the multicolor simulation and with this given this uh radius you can come up with a particular location at random and check whether it's within this uh boundary or not. Okay. So then you know the outcome. You know the outcomes, right? So uh suppose this is uh n a and the total outcome is to nt. This gives you the area right? We know this is r² and this is pi r². Sorry. Okay. Okay. Why this is 4 R square? This is 2 R, right? Okay. So using this you can easily calculate the pi. Okay. So now like since we are going to come up with these parameters through repeating the trials we need to have a standardized way of finding these parameters we can't simply say this right okay take take this example you know this uh MIT shuttles shuttles right a shuttle arriving at the right time or the the time difference between the arrival and the actual coded time can be like plot in a graph. So if you put that will be spread around zero right probably or we hope so. Okay. Now, so from this we can say uh the uh insert actually it's the mean of this simulation will give you the expected difference in the time the expected difference in the uh arrival time from the actual query time. Okay. And we hope this expectation to be zero. We call that mean. It mean is taking the average. But this distribution might actually give you some information, some extra information as well. that is how well we can actually believe this how how much we can rely on this. If the spread is greater something like this then probably you might actually not trust the system right although the mean is zero it could either come early or late right so which means it's useless okay similarly we can actually okay in this case we have a spread around mean zero but if you take uh the score the marks you get for 600. It could be something like this. It's not centered around zero, right? Hopefully, it's probably say 50. Then we actually want the spread to be small or large. We want the spread to be large because we want to like distinguish the levels, right? The students level of understanding. 600. Anyway, so this spread determines what is the variation present in the distribution of the scores. We measure that by a variable called standard deviation. In this case, this particular sample will be different from its mean by a particular value. Right? We can uh express that as xi minus its mean. Let's call the mean mu. So this will be the difference. Standard deviation is summing up all the differences. But the problem is when you sum up the differences it'll be zero right the total summation of the differences will be zero because that's how you get the mean because if you if you expand this it would be something like this right which will be n mu should be equal to zero. So we have to somehow actually take the differences into account. So let's square this. So now it will be no long it will no longer be zero. Now this gives you the differences the squared sum of the differences averaged across all the samples. We call this variance and the square root of variance is standard deviation. Okay. Now having a standard deviation. So we know the standard deviation tells you how spread the distribution is. But can we actually rely only on the standard deviation to determine the consistency of some event? Can we? Uh probably not. Suppose take a class uh where the um suppose to take two examples. One is the scores 50 and suppose the standard deviation is - 10 + 10. Okay. So the standard deviation is 10 here. Suppose it lies in this form. Consider another example. The weight the weight of a paper like say at MIT and suppose it's centered around 150. Okay. Now if the standard deviation is say 10 then the standard deviation 10 here and the standard deviation 10 here don't convey the same message. Okay. So we need to have a different way of uh expressing the consistency of a distribution. So we represent it by coefficient of variation which is equal to standard deviation divided by mean now here it will be 10 / 150 here it will be 50 sorry 10 over 50 so we know this is more consistent than this the weights of the students at MIT it's more cons more consistent than the marks you might get or you get for 600 it might be Okay. Now what is the use of the standard de distrib sorry standard deviation or how can we use them? Okay. Let's look at this graph where suppose the mean is zero and the standard deviation is say five. Okay. Consider another example where standard deviation is 10. It might have been like this. Okay. Now before that uh let me uh sort of digress a little bit so I can explain this better. We can take the outcome of a particular event as a sample in our distribution. So suppose you're throwing a die. So you get an outcome. You can represent that outcome as a distribution. Okay. So here there's x which can take 1 to say six and we can represent x i as a sample point in our distribution. So I don't know it might be uniform probably we hope. So it's with one six probability we'll always take one of these values. Okay. But this might not be the case with all events, right? Okay. So what I was what I'm trying to say here is you can actually represent the outcome of the trial in the distribution or you can also represent the probability of something happening in a distribution. How how does it work? Okay, in this case we throw a dice, we get an outcome, we go and put it in the x-axis. It could be between one and six and it takes this distribution. In addition, what what you could do is you could have say 100 trials. Say you throw you throw a coin, you take 100 trials, you get the mean of you get the probability of getting ahead and you have that mean, right? So probability of getting ahead for 100 trials say 0.51 you do another 100 trials you get another one. So you have now another another distribution. So this is a distribution of probabilities. So you can have a distribution of probabilities or you can have a distribution for the events. Uh we handle these two cases in the uh pet set. So probably uh you should be able to distinguish those two. Anyway, so here in this particular example, let's take this as our mu this take let's take this as our standard deviation. And for the first distribution, let's take the standard deviation to be five. The standard deviation is greater. It's going to be more spare. It's it's going to be more distributed than the former. So here say the standard deviation is 10. Okay. And the standard deviation is a way of expressing how many items how many samples are going to lie within those particular boundaries. So for a normal distribution we know the c we know the exact area exact probability of uh things happening. So if this is a uh mu we know within the first standard deviation there will be 68%age of events lie in that area within two standard deviations. S okay one standard deviation 68 percentage two standard deviations on either side it's going to be 95 three standard deviations it's going to be 99 percentage. So if suppose you conducted so many trials and you get the values and and for the uh in the distribution suppose mu uh mean is 10 and the standard deviation is say one. Okay. So now with 99%age confidence we can say then the outcome of the next trial is going to be between what 7 and 30 right. So this is where finding the distribution and its standard deviation helps us giving a conference interval giving a probability giving or expressing our belief of that particular event happening. Okay, we will look at few examples because uh you might need this uh in your presets. Okay, great. So this particular function you have already seen in the lecture. Okay. But we need to uh understand this particular part. Okay. Suppose you have a probability of something happening. Okay. Suppose you estimate the probability of something happening. Suppose you're given the coin is biased. Okay. Suppose sorry unbiased. So we know P of H is equal to half. How can we simulate an outcome? How can you simulate an outcome and see whether it's a head or tail with this particular probability? We do that by calling this function random.random which gives which is going to give you a random value between 0 and one. And you're going to check whether it's between below this or not. If it's below this, let's we can take it as head. If it's not, it's st. And this will happen with probability half because the random function is going to return a value between zero and one with equal probabilities. It's uniform probabilities. So to simulate a high tail, you call that function. You you uh write the expression like that. Okay. Then if you consider this example for certain number of flips we simulate the event and we count the number of heads we obtain. Okay. And also from that you can calculate the number of tails as well. Right? If you know the total flips you know the number of tails. Using that we we are taking two ratios. uh the ratio between the heads and tails and the difference between heads and tails. We are doing this for certain number of trials and we're going to take the mean and uh standard deviation of these trials. Okay. So what is so here in the in the in in our distribution what are we considering in the what is going to uh uh build our distribution here the ratios right the ratios are events okay and we simulated certain uh number of trials to get those events okay Then only if you only if you simulate certain number of trials you can actually summarize the outcome of the events in mean and standard deviation. This is exactly like the difference in the uh the times of the bus arriving uh and uh the accorded times. Okay let's uh check this example. Let's plot this and see. It's going to take a while. Okay. There's another thing I want to explain here because since you're going to we are going to plot uh we going to use pileup extensively and plot graphs. You need to put title and labels to all the plots you're going you're generating. Plus you can use this text to actually put the text in the graph. We will show that in a while. plus uh here sorry if you want to change the access to lock lock scale you can call this command at the end after calling the plot okay because you might sometimes need to change the axis to lock scale in x and y axis okay so so this is the mean heads versus tails And if you can see the mean tends to be one when we have large number of flips. So to get the consistency we need to simulate large number of trials. Okay then only will tend to be uh tend to be close to the mean. Okay. uh so this is we this is sort of way of checking the evolution of the series by by actually u doing it for certain number of flips at every time. So it's quite like a scatter plot. The scatter plot is like plotting the outcomes of our experiments. Suppose it's x1 and x2 in a graph. So we are going so so for example suppose you have two outcomes sorry uh suppose you have a variable and the variable causes an outcome probability of the coin flip uh so p of h and it can result in certain number of heads appearing say n of h. Now you can do a a scatter plot between these two variables then it will be probably uh spread but we know that if you increase the probability of heads the number of heads is going to increase as well. So it would be probably something like this. Okay from this we can assume that it's linear or something like that. The scatter plot is actually representing the outcomes of the trial versus some other variable in the graph and visualize it. Okay. And uh let me show the last graph and we'll be done with that. So this is again we we actually now uh instead of putting a scatter plot we actually giving the distribution as a histogram and printing putting a text box in the graph. This might be useful if you want to put a uh if you want to display something on your graph. Okay. Uh I guess we will be uploading the code to the site so you can check the code if you want later. Okay. Sure. See you next week.
