welcome to exploring computing today's video is digital images part 4 the right format for the right job so what i want to talk about in this video is different image formats that you might use i'm going to focus primarily on formats that are used on the web in this little diagram here we can see the primary formats that are used on the web there's one object format that's used on the web and that's svg it's relative newcomer to use on the web although it has been around for a while it has a lot of similarities to html so i'm going to hold off discussing how it actually works and what it looks like until after we've talked about html later in the quarter html is the primary way of specifying the contents of a web page so we'll be covering html when we cover web pages which is probably in about four weeks or so the main thing to be thinking about as far as svg goes is if you can describe your image using a bunch of different geometric shapes svg is a great format we talked about that last video how object also known as vector formats for images are very compact they have a lot of nice properties as far as editing goes being able to zoom in to the image and so this is a great choice if the particular image that you're working with will fit into the object format we also talked about how for a lot of uses the bitmap format is a much better choice and in particular if we've got something like a photograph the object slash vector format is not going to work and so we would want to use a bitmap format also the bitmap formats has just traditionally been used much more widely on the web there is an older object format called flash which was used primarily for advertising but also for fun little games that were on the web but it's been on its way out for quite a while and i do expect that it's going to be replaced completely by svg all right so we've got a number of different bitmap formats in addition to the three main formats used on the web jpeg png and gif there are a couple other formats that you might be interested in raw and heic heic is the format that apple uses when you take a photograph with an iphone it's going to be stored in heic format and raw is a format that's specifically used on high-end cameras now neither of these formats is available for use on the web so you're going to have to convert from either raw or heic to one of the other formats that we're going to be talking about today but i do think that raw and hcic are going to be potentially interesting and useful for some of you so we are going to touch on them briefly today all right so the bitmap format is concerned with what is the individual value of each of the colors for each of the pixels that compose the image now one thing that you might be thinking is well isn't there just one bitmap format you're either remembering things as objects and you can kind of picture how we could have possibly different object formats on the basis of well how complicated do we want to get do we want to just be able to support you know ovals and rectangles or do we want to get super complicated and do things like spline curves and there are actually a wide range of different object formats that are proprietary svg is just the one that's actually widely supported for web use but as far as bitmap formats isn't it just a matter of we just remember all the individual pixel values and what the colors are for those pixels well it turns out that it's actually a bit more complicated than that even though ultimately we are trying to remember what the different values for all the individual pixels is it turns out that there are different ways of representing the same information so what we're going to do now is we're going to take a look at this example with the h that we we saw previously when we were talking about black and white monitors so i've got an h here on my macbook pro and i want to know how to describe what is being displayed on the screen suppose for example i'm trying to describe this h to one of my tas when we're talking over the phone how can i do that well the standard approach uh is to just think of this as a straight grid with a whole bunch of pixels and i just go ahead and read off each of the pixel values so i say oh zero zero is off one zero is off two zero's off and i proceed to read the entire first line which is all off i move to the second line um you'll notice that these numbers actually start with zero zero that's pretty common in computer science um so the next the next line is line one so i would say oh zero one is off one one is off two one is off and so on i would get to the the third row which is uh number two since we're starting with zero zero one two um and i say oh zero two's off one two's off three two's on four two is off five two is on 62 is off and your party probably already sick of of hearing this and believe me if i were actually reading all these values over the phone to the ta they would be very very sick of it one and two it would be super easy for them to accidentally get one of these on or off wrong so this this particular approach works but talking over the phone and describing it is obviously very time consuming and similarly storing all these individual pixel values is going to take a lot of space on on the computer so this is an ideal is there a better way to do this well yeah actually it is there is let's take a look at the second approach here okay so here is a second approach to describing the exact same screen i'm talking to the ta over the telephone i say oh row zero it's all off row one is the same as row zero row two is the same as row zero except for 2 2 and 4 2 are both on row 3 is the same as row 2 except for 3 3 is on as well and row 4 is the same as row 2 and all the other rows are exactly the same as row 0. okay so i've described the exact same scene and the ta is able to get the exact same amount of information as if i had read off all the individual pixel values but you can see that this is a much more compact way of describing the exact same situation and so it does turn out that there are different ways that i can describe what all the individual pixels are and the first approach where i actually just read off all the individual pixel values this is a format that's sometimes referred to as bmp or bitmap format and it works but it's very large and because it takes up a fair amount of space in order to do it that means if we download it for the internet it's going to take a fair amount of time and therefore we don't use that format it's going to turn out that two out of the three formats that we're going to be talking about today actually use a very similar approach to my compact version where i said hey you know that row is exactly the same as this other row that we've already seen and by combining our rows together and saying hey this is the same something you've already seen we're able to greatly reduce the amount of space this takes this is sometimes referred to as compression because we've taken the information that we started off with we've changed the format that we're using to describe that information and in changing the format we've reduced the amount of space it takes so this is referred to as compression okay so the first of our file formats that we're going to be looking at is jpeg jpeg stands for joint photographics experts group which is the name of the group that came up with this particular format but i'm guessing 90 of the people that use this format have no idea what it stands for it's just called jpeg jpeg is designed to store photographs so if you've got a photograph you should probably use jpeg in fact most consumer cameras and most cell phones pre iphone switching to heic just when you take a photograph it just immediately converts it to jpeg with iphones if you want to put it on the web or you want to send it to somebody that doesn't have an iphone you're going to need to convert it to jpeg often the applications are going to immediately convert it to jpeg automatically for you so if you're going to text a post a photograph to a friend and they don't have an iphone it will automatically get converted to jpeg now jpeg stores 24-bit color so that means you have the full 16.7 million color range it does have an interesting drawback that we'll see doesn't show up with all the techniques we're going to be using jpeg is what we refer to as a lossy compression format so what this means is this actually loses information i've got two images of venice here and on the left hand side i've got a 1944 by 2592 image of venice and this is 1.39 megabytes and on the right side i have 1944 by 2592 again same pixel resolution but this image on the right is only 215 kilobytes so the image on the right is 1 6 the size of the image on the left now if we're looking at these how many of you can tell the difference between these two images so we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and zoom in and we're going to take a close look at just one section of the image now if you look at this rail running along the top of the building here on the right you'll notice that the rail on the image on the left that's the large size image you can actually see the rail pretty pretty easily and on the right side of the image it's just kind of this big old mess similarly if you look at the guy wires holding up the edifice on the right side they're kind of messed up and on the left side you can tell that they actually are wires you can also see if you look along the edge of the roof you can see that on the left it looks clean and on the right it just kind of jumbled up so we're seeing here is these are jpeg compression artifacts whenever you use jpeg you are losing information so as soon as you snap that camera you're losing information and you're getting these jpeg compression artifacts but the thing about jpeg is we can control how much compression actually occurs so we can say oh i want my image to look pretty close to what the camera's actually seeing so i'm gonna i'm going to sacrifice some space i'm going to have a very large jpeg file with very little compression artifacts or i could say you know this thing's going to go up on the web and i don't think anybody's really going to notice of that guy wire or that that railing along the edge of that roof is a little bit messed up nobody's going to notice and i want a nice small image so that it will easily quickly download on the web so um apple's new heic format also does compression it does a better job with compression than jpeg it's newer format if you don't want any compression at all to take place if you wanted to snap that image with your camera and get the exact same thing stored on your disk that the camera actually saw that's what the raw format is for so high-end cameras have a raw format that will store the original image that the camera saw when you took took the photograph other cameras and phones are going to do some compression they'll say well i can use this mathematical formula that's part of jpeg or that's part of heic that's going to greatly reduce the amount of space that this image is going to store and most people are not going to notice these compression artifacts at all so let's go ahead and do that okay so our next format is png png stands for portable network graphics although as with jpeg probably very few people know what png stands for they just refer to them as pngs png's is a relatively new format it builds on an older format referred to as gif which we will take a look at in a minute pngs and gifs are both designed to store diagrams and graphics so what i mean by this is they're designed to store images that are generated by hand or with computer graphics as opposed to photographs pngs and gifs both use a technique very similar to that technique that we talked about earlier with the h where i said oh what we're going to do is we're going to reduce the amount of space this takes by looking at sections which are exactly the same so if you think about a photograph there really aren't parts of the photograph where you can say well that pixel this set of pixels over here in the top left is exactly the same as the pixels on the on on the right so you know maybe you can say well this section is all ocean and it's more or less the same but it's not exactly the same whereas on a diagram you can definitely say well this line on the diagram is exactly the same as this other line in the diagram or you know this section up here is exactly the same as this other section and so that's really the way png's and gifs work they're looking for those sections that are exactly the same so you can take a photograph and you can store it as a png but it's not very efficient the jpeg format and the technique used for the jpeg compression is specifically designed for photographs and it's designed to store photographs efficiently the png technique and the gif technique is specifically designed to allow you to store diagrams in an efficient manner in contrast with the jpegs though the png format is not lossy so you know just as with our h example where you know i changed how i was describing the h to the ta and even though i was describing that h in a different way where i'm like oh that line's the same as the next line these four lines here they're exactly the same um these pixels here are the same as this other section of pixels over there you know if i'm describing the image to the ta in that manner i'm not actually losing any information i'm just changing how it's being described they are still able to reproduce the exact image that we started with and so that's the way png's and gifts work they're going to be able to give us an exact reproduction of the original but they're going to take up less space than actually storing each of the individual pixels now png's and gifs do have another interesting feature that's not available in jpeg and this is the ability to make some of the individual pixels transparent so let me show you how this works so what we've got here is we've got the stanford seal and i'm showing it over a white background and you can see that the seal fits in very nicely here and it looks like it matches really nicely now what we're going to do is we're going to take the stamper steel and put it on a gray background and you can see that what's happened here is i can see that the seal even though the seal is a circle i can see that i'm actually taking the seal along with the rectangle surrounding the seal and so the white background is really going to show up here so what i'm going to be able to do with pngs or gifs is i'm going to be able to designate certain pixels as being transparent which means whatever is behind it will show up instead of worrying about what what is in the diagram itself so um here we go you can see i've have a transparent version of the seal where i've gotten rid of the parts of the rectangle that aren't directly inside of the the circle and the seal and you can see i've gotten rid of the interior of the seal as well and so i can put this over a variety of different backgrounds so here it is in front of gray and you'll recall last lecture uh we talked about creating colors like see green here it is in front of seed green here is in front of tomato and burly wood and so i can put this seal in front of lots of different backgrounds and the pixels that are marked as transparent will go ahead show whatever's underneath them in most editing programs that when you're working with a format that does support transparency the transparent sections will show up as a checkerboard pattern so this is what the seal would look like with no transparency and this is what the seal looks like with transparency in adobe photoshop okay we've got one last format that we need to cover and that's gif gif is famous because it allows us to create small animations um this is essentially a series of still images packed together into the same file that are played one image followed by the next image followed by the next image so this isn't really full video video formats are a bit different and they're going to be more efficient if you've got a whole bunch of video that you want to shoot you don't really want to use gif for for anything particularly long um gif actually can be replaced now by animated png but support for animated png is relatively recent there's still a lot of web browsers out there that aren't going to be able to show your animated png so if you want everybody to be able to see your short little animate loop you should go ahead and use gif gif as an older format only supports 256 colors as opposed to the 16.7 million colors we've been using so you'll notice that a lot of gifs seem a little bit pixelated and that's because they don't really have quite as many colors as you would want in order to provide a really nicely done scene they do support transparency similar to pngs but really they've been overtaken by pngs the main reason why you would run into them is these short little animated loops and they actually do show up as you've probably seen quite a bit on the web all right the next lecture will be our last lecture on how computers represent information and in that lecture we're going to take a look at how computers represent sounds and music i'll see you soon you
