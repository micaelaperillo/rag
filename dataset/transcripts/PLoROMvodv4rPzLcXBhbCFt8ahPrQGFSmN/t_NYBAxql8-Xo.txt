welcome to exploring computing today's video is digital images part two let's get colorful let's go back to the last lecture where we had our laptop and we had a magnifying glass and what we're going to do is we're going to somehow crank up the magnifying ability of that magnifying glass and take an even close look at this computer screen what will happen when we take an even closer look at the computer screen is we will discover that each the individual pixels consists of not a single square which is either on or off it actually consists of a number of what are referred to as sub pixels now the exact geometric configuration of these subpixels will vary from one computer to another mostly on the basis of what the particular computing technology used is for most lcd screens the sub pixels will actually be bars and there will be a red bar a green bar and a blue bar if we were to take a close look at an old school cathode ray tube or crt we would actually see that there are actually three different circles but again there would be a red circle a green circle and a blue circle and you will hear computer scientists often talking about rgb where r stands for red g stands for green and b stands for blue so most color on the computer is done using rgb we'll take a look in a couple minutes about how printers work and they actually have a different system called cmyk we'll take a look at that a little bit later for now though let's again take a look at our red green and blue the idea here is that by mixing the amount of red green and blue we can actually generate different colors let's take a look at a little computer program i wrote a couple years ago this particular program is actually written in python which is the programming language that cs105 students will be learning a little bit later on this quarter although we won't quite get to the point where we'll be making slight graphical user interfaces like this so this particular program shows what happens when we mix red green and blue colors together right now i've got red green and blue all set to zero so there's no light on at all and so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to go ahead and crank up the red here and you can see i'm slowly getting more and more red and i can max it out at 255 which is the maximum amount of red that the computer can put out and let's go ahead and turn that down you can see i can do the same thing with the green and then finally blue and then of course the interesting thing is when we go ahead and try and mix them so here i've got a little bit of blue maybe about 30 percent i can go ahead and mix in some green you can see i get different shades of green here depending on how much green intensity i have i can start mixing in some red and by mixing these different colors and changing the intensity of the red the green and the blue i'm actually able to create lots of different colors and so this is actually how the computer itself is going to be generating colors it's got that red green and blue bar or as we saw in the crt it's got those red green and blue circles and by increasing the intensity of those individual bars it's actually mixing colors we don't see the individual colors because they're really really small and so what our eyes see is just the lights that are being combined together but in fact if we were to take a microscope here to the computer screen we would actually see the individual bars lighting up at different intensities let's take a look at some actual color examples so naturally red consists of red turned all the way up with no green and no blue although we can create different shades of red by either increasing or decreasing the intensity of the red from the maximum amount to some lesser amount or by slightly mixing in some green or some blue blue is of course similar with no red no green and the max amount of blue and then we can start mixing things so if we turn our red sub pixel to half the maximum intensity turn the green sub pixel off turn the blue sub pixel to half the maximum intensity we'll get purple if we turn the red all the way up and the blue all the way up again leaving the green off we're going to actually end up with fuchsia similarly if we turn the green to half the blue to half turn off the red we get aqua whereas if we crank up the green and the blue all the way again leaving the red still off we would actually get teal we can get more exotic colors as well so here's some samples these are from the html5 specification which we'll be talking about later this quarter you can see here see green consists of green but not green up at maximum intensity only 139 out of 255 and then mixing in some red and some blue but mostly those are pretty far down remember this is a scale that goes from zero to 255. burly wood consists of a lot of red a fair amount of green and still a fair amount of blue but less than the amount of green and red and a tomato you know that that's mostly red red turned up pretty much the maximum here but also mixing in some green and some blue so these are examples of the different types of colors we can create using this system and in fact we can create 16.7 million colors using this particular system how did i get to 16.7 million colors well let's take a closer look at how these colors are actually represented inside the computer here's how the color cardinal red is represented inside the computer we can see that there are 24 bits or 24 switches used to represent this particular color these 24 bits are broken up into sets of eight which you'll recall refer to as bytes so we have one byte set aside for red one byte set aside for green and one byte set aside for blue in this diagram you can see that i put the decimal equivalent on here so that the combination of red switches on the far left the combination of red bits on the far left is equivalent of a decimal 140. the combination of eight bits in the middle corresponds to the amount of green which is a decimal 21 and the combination on the right again is the same as the switches for the green and that again represents the decimal number 21. so the computer knows it should set the red to somewhere a bit over half maximum intensity and then it should add in just a little bit of green and just a little bit of blue now because the amount of red is represented by eight bits and you'll recall from our previous lecture that in eight bits we can represent two to the eighth combinations which is 256. we'll want one of those combinations to represent zero representing that no light comes out of that particular subpixel so instead of going from 1 to 256 we'll go from 0 to 255. so we have red 0 to 255 green 0 to 255 and blue 0 to 255 which is what you saw in our last example when i was sliding around the sliders on a little python program now because i have two to the eighth possible combinations of red two to the eighth possible combination of the green and two to the eighth possible combinations of blue i actually have a total of two to the 24 possible combinations and it turns out that if you work out all the possible combinations with all 24 bits i get a bit over 16.7 million so we generally say that in 24-bit color we can represent 16.7 million colors now this 24-bit color system is one of the most common color systems used on computers today but there's a fancier variant of this which uses an extra byte this is the 32-bit color system in the 32-bit color system we actually have an additional byte and that additional byte is actually set aside to represent something called alpha alpha represents the opacity or transparency of a particular object and we use this if we're sliding one object on top of another object we want to show a little bit of the object underneath it and you can commonly see this technique used when we're moving windows around an operating system let's take a closer look at how our alpha works what i've got here is i've got a pair of images here i have an image underneath which is uh parked near the louvre and then i've got an image of the tower of london in the top left-hand corner i have the park overlaid with the tower of london and i have alpha set to higher percent with alpha set to 100 percent the london bridge image is going to be completely opaque we will not be able to see through it but as we reduce the opacity we'll be able to see increasing amounts of the paris park underneath it here we've got alpha set to 192 out of 255 which is 75 percent you can see that the the park is starting to bleed through um if we reduce it even further here alpha's set to 50 or 128 out of 255 and you can see that we're starting to see a lot more of the park underneath and you can also see that um our parts of the tower of london which are not on uh on the paris park are starting to look a little bit faded and then finally in our last image here um i've got alpha set to 25 which is 64 out of 255 and you can see that um we can almost completely see the park and the image of tower of london is almost completely faded if we crank down alpha even further we were to set alpha for example to zero we would not be able to see the tower of london image at all let's take our newfound knowledge and apply it to something practical say for example suppose we're interested in buying a new television here's a webpage for a new television from samsung on the best buy website so if we take a quick look at this webpage the first thing that stands out to me is you can buy a brand new hd television for 329.99 why don't i have one of these seriously um these prices are really low anyway so let's take a look at uh the specifications for this television we'll focus on the title line here we can see this is a samsung that's the manufacturer that it's 55 inch this is the distance from one corner of the display screen to the opposite corner we can see that it's an led this is talking about the display technology used this is as opposed to say for example a plasma television or an old-school cathode ray tube television the new 6900 series that's an internal samsung designation so that's not something that's going to be particularly useful unless you're planning to buy specifically samsung television so this is 2160p the 2160 refers to the number of pixels from top to bottom the p actually stands for progressive all modern displays are progressive in order to understand what progressive is we need to take a look at an older technology which uses an interlaced signal so for example an old-school vcr tape was interlaced and the idea here on an interlaced signal was that um instead of updating every single line on the television we would update every other line on the television so let's say our signal was coming in and we were able to get information 30 times a second what would happen on interlaced signal is the first 30th of a second every odd line on the television would be updated and then the next 30th of a second every even line would be updated and then every odd line would be updated and every even line would be updated and progressive television every line is updated all at once so this is on the one hand this is a really good thing this is actually the big difference between vcr tapes which were interlaced and dvds which were progressive so you know if you've ever played those two technologies this was a huge improvement but it's not particularly interesting to us as someone that's buying a new television because all new televisions are progressive smart is referring to the fact that this can be connected directly to the internet and that there uh that it has the built-in ability to do things like display say for example netflix or hulu or disney plus 4k is referring to the number of pixels wide in this case there are 3840 pixels across from left to right and uhd tv refers to ultra high definition television which again refers to the fact that this has a lot of pixels wide and a lot of pixels tall so this is ultra high definition television is as opposed to high definition television which is 1920 by 1080 pixels and so we can actually fit four hdtv displays onto this television because this has four times as many pixels if we go ahead and multiply out the number of pixels from left to right and top to bottom this is four times as many as would be found on hd television i think this last part here the hdr is actually the most interesting so hdr refers to high dynamic range there have been a number of important improvements in display technology since say for example the dvds were defined one of the differences is that we have much higher pixels per inch so you know we've just seen that this has many many pixels tall and many pixels across in fact we have four times as many pixels as on hd television another difference though is that modern televisions have much better contrast so the difference between the darkest darks and the lightest lights is much much higher than they used to be and we also have higher overall brightness now in order to take advantage of this contrast between the darkest darks and the lightest lights we need a new system for defining colors we've talked previously about how modern computer technology uses 24-bit color so eight bits for red eight bits for green eight bits for blue um 24 bits overall leading to a total of 16.7 million colors what hdr does is it actually increases number of bits for each individual pixel it increases the number of bits for each of the color channels there are a number of different competing standards there's one standard that uses 10 bits for color channels and another one that uses 12 bits for color channels i'm going to talk about the 10 bit for color channel example because this seems much more prevalent so one of these 10 bit per color channel standards is this hdr 10. with hdr 10 we're going to set aside 10 bits for red 10 bits for green and 10 bits for blue and what this is going to do is instead of allowing us to set intensities between 0 and 255 for each of these three color channels we're going to be able to store intensities between 0 to 1023 intensity so we're able to have many many more gradations and in fact um if we were to go ahead and do the math remember before we had 2 to the 24th giving us 16.7 million colors now we have 2 to the 30th which gives us over a billion colors so this is just going to give us much more variation of colors and much more able to represent an actual image so this is actually a pretty neat technology that should greatly improve your image on your television set previously i alluded that printers use a different color technology than displays do so let's take a quick look at this the main idea here is that the printed page and paintings create color a different way than our laptop display does let's take a quick look so our laptop or our computer or television create color using what's referred to as additive color the colors generated by these different display technologies create color and shine them into our eyes in contrast if we think about how a painting or printed page works what we want is we want a bright white light and the white light will shine on our printed page or our painting and what happens is the different inks in that printed page or the paints used by that painting are going to absorb parts of that white light so the white light contains all the different colors in the color spectrum and some of those colors get absorbed by the printed page or the painting and what remains gets sent into our eyes or gets reflected into our eyes and so this is referred to as subtractive color so this is a fundamentally different way of generating color than what we've seen with the displays and so there's actually a different set of primary colors used for printing technology as we previously seen the computer screens use rgb red green and blue as our primary colors and it turns out that the printers use cmyk so they use cyan magenta yellow and black and so if you were to buy a printer cartridge you're not going to see that printer cartridges have red green and blue they actually have cyan magenta yellow and black you don't actually need black it is technically possible to create blacks mixing a whole bunch of cyan magenta and yellow inks but it turns out that that uses a lot of ink and sometimes gives you kind of muddy results another thing to note about rgb versus cmyk is it turns out that there are colors that you can generate in one color scheme that you can't generate in another so you really should be making a decision when you're going to create an image whether that image is meant to be used on a computer screen or on a printed page and so what you can do is you can choose certain colors because you know that they're going to work well in one of the color schemes and not in the other color scheme you'll also discover we're going to talk later in the quarter about how to design a website and color schemes for websites and one of the ways that you might choose colors for a website is you're going to use a color wheel it turns out that there's a different color wheel used by artists and the artist color wheel naturally using the the primary colors for painting using subtractive color whereas the web color wheel is used based on the additive color of rgb okay we've been looking at how computer displays work and how they generate color what we're going to look at next is how programs represent images and manipulate images and then we're going to take a look at different formats that are available to store image information and we're going to talk about the different choices you'll have when using images on the worldwide web in the proper formats to be using you
