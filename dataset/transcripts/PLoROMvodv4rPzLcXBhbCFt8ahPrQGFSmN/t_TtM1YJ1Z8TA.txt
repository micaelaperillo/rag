welcome to exploring computing today's video is introduction to html origins of the web so in this video we're going to take a look at where the worldwide web comes from i think having an understanding of the background of why the world wide web is created and where it comes from is going to give you a better sense of what's actually going on when we take a look at how the web works and when you see what some of the limitations are and some of the oddities involved with the web so the world wide web comes from two basic technologies the first one is the internet which we've spent quite a bit of time studying over the last couple lectures and the second one is a technology called hypertext and so we're going to start off by taking a look at hypertext the basic idea behind hypertext is how are we going to present information for people and we've been using the book for forever and so the question is what are the limitations of the book and what might we want to do to replace it and this is a question that information scientists have been thinking about for quite some time and in fact we started thinking about how information technology might provide a good replacement for books right around the end of world war ii so there's a famous article by van over bush called as we may think and that came out in 1945. now as i mentioned one of the key technologies behind the web is hypertext the beginnings of hypertext and hypermedia actually date back to 1963. probably the first widespread use of hypertext and hypermedia were electronic encyclopedias found on cd-roms microsoft and carta starting in 1993 provides a really good example of this uses that technology and the worldwide web first came out in 1989 which you'll note actually precedes microsoft and cardiff but it was only in use by a very limited number of people and we'll be taking a look at that in a couple of minutes all right so what's wrong with the book why would we want to replace it well one thing about a book is a book consists of pages and each of the pages follows a preceding page sequentially i mean that's fairly obvious but it turns out this can be a pretty big limitation it really depends on what sort of book we're looking at so we have page one followed by page two followed by page three and so on and we're reading fiction this is probably a good choice unless let's say it's a mystery novel and you just can't handle waiting till the end and so you flip to the end to see what's going on or possibly you're a literary criticism major and you want to jump around the book but most of us are perfectly happy with the linear nature of fiction novels in contrast think about something like an encyclopedia because an encyclopedia is printed it's got that single sequential information flow so if we're looking for an article on the reverend martin luther king we're likely to find him sandwiched between king george of england and king philip of spain what does he have to do with those two well the encyclopedia only has one ordering of information and it uses that linear ordering of information to make it easy to look up articles not to find links between different articles and so when we move to computers we're no longer limited to that single ordering of information we can create different nodes of information and link any node to any other node so we can still maintain our sequence of information for lookup if we wanted to but we could also link director martin luther king to articles on the civil rights movement to selma alabama to great leaders of the 20th century and so on we now have a web of information which is where the term worldwide web comes from of course and this concept of hypertext basically said that we have these different text nodes and that we're going to link the text nodes and of course this is exactly how the world wide web works we can take things a step further on the computer because we're no longer limited to just text we can have speeches we can have audio so we can have the reverend martin luther king's i have a dream speech we can have photographs we can have movies and so this is called hypermedia okay so that's the basic idea behind hypertext and hypermedia but that still doesn't get us the worldwide web yet that's only half the equation we've seen that the other half of the equation is the internet but how did the two end up together well we need to move to europe and in europe there's a physics consortium called cern it has 23 member countries and its main headquarters in geneva it's most famous for a large collider which is used for high energy physics not that different from our very own stanford slack and in this case they have a 27 kilometer ring which is used for high energy physics and smashing particles into each other now in the late 80s one of the computer scientists working for cern was interested in coming up with a way for the physicists at cern to share research papers one of the things that happens at cern is the member countries send their physicists to cern and then sometimes they return to their own institutions in their various countries and so he was looking for a way to share papers between all the physicists and naturally he thought we should use the internet but in addition he thought we should use that hypertext technology that people have been talking about and it's been sitting on a research lab for quite some time and nobody's actually using if you hear some tinkling in the background that is actually maddie drinking from her dog ball and her her dog tags hitting the dog bowl anyway so tim berners-lee in 1989 came up with this idea of combining the internet with hypertext in order to share information between physicists and this is the origin of the world wide web he was knighted for it in 2004. so i think it's important when you look at the world wide web and you wonder why some of the things work the way they do on the world wide web it was originally invented to allow physicists to share physics research papers and so it didn't really have the sort of technologies we might want for widespread mass media usage we'll see that some of them have been tacked on but there's still some things that like i think if you were designing the system specifically for mass market and for regular consumers you might have come up with a slightly different formalism for how the addresses work and we are going to see that there's a lot of stuff that had to get added in order to provide for much more colorful much more interesting web pages than you might expect to see in a physics paper all right so in the next video we're going to take a look at html which is actually the language used to create web pages i'll talk to you soon
