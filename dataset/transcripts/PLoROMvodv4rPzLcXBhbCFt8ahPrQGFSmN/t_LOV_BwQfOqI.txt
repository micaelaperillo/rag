welcome to exploring computing today's video is bits bytes and binary part one or it's all about zero and one computers use the binary number system so let's take a look at what binary numbers look like we'll begin by comparing decimal numbers which are the numbers we're used to to binary numbers decimal numbers are based on the decimal number system which is the number system that you are used to in the decimal number system there are 10 different digits 0 through 9. all the numbers that you're used to seeing contain these 10 different digits we also sometimes refer to this number system as base 10. in contrast the computer uses a binary number system in the binary number system there are only two digits zero and one here are some examples of the different types of numbers that you can make with the binary number system we'll take a look in another video on exactly how these work and what they might mean but for now just realize that all numbers in the binary number system consist of only two digits zero and one and because of this because there are only two digits we sometimes refer to numbers using this number system as being base 2. what i want to look at next is why computers use the binary number system if we were to open up the computer and look at computer memory what we would discover is that computer memories actually consists of a whole bunch of different individual electronic switches we can think of these electronic switches as being not that different than your light switch and just as a light switch on the wall can either be on or off our switches inside the computer can be on or off when the switch is off we think of that as representing the number zero and when the switch is on we think of that as representing a one so each of our switches corresponds to a single digit and since these digits can only be zero or one they're binary digits and we shorten binary digit to bit so when you hear somebody talking about a bit what they're talking about is a zero or a one or the memory inside the computer which is being used to store that zero or one now we can't really do a whole lot with a single bit so we combine the bits together into groups and the main grouping for bits is a set of eight bits which is referred to as a byte the byte is the primary measure of computer storage while i've been describing what happens inside the main computer memory all computer data is ultimately stored as bits and bytes so there are a variety of different mediums that we use to store digital information and in each case that digital media needs to be set up to store zeros and ones or bits and bytes so an ssd drive which is what's inside most of your laptops stores information basically using electronic switches very similar to the ones we've described here however if you've got a hard disk if you open up the hard disk what you're going to discover is that there are individual sections on the disk itself that are magnetically polarized and depending on the polarity if the polarity is in one direction it will be considered a zero if the polarity's in the opposite direction will be considered a one if we take a close look at a cd a dvd or blu-ray what we're going to discover is that the consists of a number of different sections which are either what referred to as pits or lands depending upon whether there's a pit in that section of the disk or a land in the section of the disk ultimately what we're representing with these pits and lands is zeros and ones so again ultimately all information used by the computer is going to be storing these zeros and ones or these bits and they'll be organized into groups of eight called bytes while our first video has been rather short the other videos in this lecture are much longer in the next video we're going to take a look at how binary numbers actually work
