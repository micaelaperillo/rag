welcome to exploring computing today's video is computer security defensive techniques so in the last video we saw lots of ways your computer can get attacked what sort of things can we do to protect ourselves so that's what this video is all about so the first thing i want to talk about is firewalls we'll talk about corporate firewalls first and then we'll talk about personal firewalls so first of all let's consider what happens if we have a company with no firewall um so we've got a company internal intranet and every computer in the internet can access the internet this means that all our computers are vulnerable to attacks from outside it also means potentially you know we've got somebody who wants to do something internally uh like maybe we've got somebody who's spying they can send information out of the company there's no controls at all so this is this is clearly a bad situation so what a firewall computer is is it's a computer that stands between the corporate intranet and the wider internet so it's going to prevent malicious traffic from going into the company it can also prevent malicious information from going out of the company there's a variety of different things that the firewall can do so one thing it could do is it can block specific applications or it could alternatively white list certain applications so basically it's going to be looking at all the traffic coming in and let's say somebody's trying to access like ftp on one of our computers it'll be like hey that computer's not supposed to be doing file transfer i don't know why you're while you're trying to access that computer and try and file transfer from it or it could be um we'll we'll talk about in a minute about uh which computers are actually allowed to access the internet but uh you know it could say oh that's not the right computer to be accessing files from so this looks kind of suspicious um it can either block certain ip numbers or white list certain ip numbers so uh you know we can limit which computers either employees can access or we can limit which of our computers outsiders can access it can also scan for for information in uh incoming or outgoing traffic so i actually work for a company i was actually a visiting researcher at ibm federal systems and we were not allowed to use our computers including our email for private purposes and i was told that they actually would scan the emails to look for words like football and email because that was a sign that you were using your emails for personal purposes this was just on the cusp when normal non-computer scientists were starting to use email and i actually told them that i did not think this policy was going to fly with the next generation of graduates but uh they said that the government contracts they were on did not allow the use of on-site computers for personal email anyway all right uh so as i alluded to a minute ago um if you want to get a little bit fancier what you can do is you have all the internal computers um sending all their traffic through the firewall computer which is protecting both from outside influences and people on the inside doing things they shouldn't and sending that information outside of the intranet but you've also got a series of additional computers such as web servers or file servers which are given direct access to the internet so like let's say we've got a product that we have and we've got some you know maybe some updates or patches uh that we have a file server that people can go go ahead and download those from you know those would be clearly something that um people from outside of our company should be able to access similarly the web server that's obviously something people should be able to access and so a more sophisticated art architecture says that we've got these a special set of computers or a smaller sub network that's referred to as the dmz um this is short for demilitarized zone uh which is a general term but it's probably most widely known for the dmz between north and south korea so the idea is you know we've got uh i suppose we're south korea in this in this scenario um and we've got that demilitarized zone that's uh carefully protected um and then there's the wild west outside which is the internet okay modern computers also have a personal firewall so um even though you know some of you will be working for companies uh that have firewalls but you all have computers um many of you have well i suppose all of you have computers that you use for personal purposes not for work purposes so uh there is what's referred to as a personal firewall this is uh generally part of the operating system at this point and so the personal firewall is going to act similar to what we just saw a minute ago with the corporate firewall so first of all let's take a look at the situation with no firewall with no firewall all of your programs just communicate directly with the internet and the internet communicates directly with your programs what the personal firewall does is uh again typically part of the operating system this is going to act as an intermediary where all traffic from programs on your computer need to go through the personal firewall and the personal firewall will either say yeah okay you're authorized to send this information out or i don't know what you're doing you're not allowed to send information out and so the idea here is let's say something gets installed on your computer that shunt like let's say you ran a treasure horse or something um and now you've got this program it's a key logger uh hopefully the personal firewall will prevent that key logger from sending information out to the hacker um you know it will try and send information on the internet and hopefully the personal firewall will be like um you're not you're not allowed to send information off of the computer so i don't know what you're doing but i'm not going to let you do it similarly people are constantly trying to get onto the computer particularly if you've got a server that's running 24 hours a day i've talked to different students at rccs in the dorms who are in charge of the computers and dormitories who've run servers before and they say that it's surprising how many times their computers get hit by people trying to get on so what the personal firewall does in the opposite direction is it only allows packets through that are uh for services that you are currently using so you know like my computers don't use ftp they're not acting as ftp servers so if somebody were to try and access my computer using the secure ftp protocol my firewall should say um we're not a secure uh ftp server i don't know why you think you're accessing it but clearly your traffic is unwanted you are most likely to run it to the personal firewall you used to have to turn these on explicitly but at this point i think all the operating systems are are running them by default you're most likely to run into the firewall when you install a new program so typically what would happen is if you're installing a program that needs to use the internet like let's say i hear this this cool new game and uh you know my friends want me to play with them so i go ahead and install on my computer well in order for me to play this game with my friends um it needs to send information off of my computer so uh the firewall software would say okay patrick you're trying to run this game and uh it's asking if it can send information out to the internet should i go ahead and approve access to the internet for this particular program and then you can say yes i have noticed that a surprising number of programs these days seem to want access to the internet my suspicion is many of them want access to the internet for update purposes which is a good thing generally but it's not always clear so um yeah i don't have any great suggestions but certainly if you have things asking for access to the internet and it's not something that you think you installed at minimum you should go ahead and google it sometimes it will be part of a pre-existing program so for example um i run adobe products that's how i'm making this video right now um and this diagram you're looking at this was created in photoshop this video you're listening to right now is being done with adobe premiere adobe installs a whole bunch of junk on your computer i'm sure it all does something but like i run into when for example i try and shut down the computer and it won't shut down because these adobe things will not stop running and i'm like i don't know what those things are they're not the names of the applications and it turns out they're like helper programs that adobe has installed so it's certainly possible for something to get installed on your computer and ask for access to the internet and actually be legitimate but definitely google it if you're not sure what it is you don't remember installing something super recently or even if you do and that's not what's asking to access the internet you should double check it um anyway so that's the personal firewall okay our next topic is proxy servers so uh proxy server is used to basically allow somebody who is trying to access a resource and they aren't able to access that resource directly access it anyway so i'm going to use an example where we're trying to access something that we can normally access from stanford but there's a couple other situations where this could be used and i'll talk about those in a minute okay so uh let's say there's a restricted resource that stanford pays for so for example if you're looking for books on computer science you're trying to learn a new programming language you want to learn more about html and css as a stanford affiliate you have access to safari online which provides a vast number of books on a wide range of computer related topics it's actually a really great resource so uh if i try and access safari online and i'm on campus what happens is safari online can look at who's trying to access it and i could say oh that's a stanford computer stanford is allowed to access our resources so i'm going to go ahead and let that request go through so that works that's great and then somebody else on campus tries to access it same thing and so what it's really doing is it's looking at the ip numbers and as we all know now uh ip numbers for stanford computers all have the same initial prefix numbers and so it's pretty easy for a computer like safari online servers to tell oh this is a standard computer now suppose i am no longer on campus i'm at home what is going to happen um now if you live on campus you're still golden but if you're not living on campus that's kind of a problem and so what stanford does to support those of us who are not living on campus is they run what's called a proxy server and the way the proxy server is going to work is okay so let's say i'm not using the proxy server i am trying to access this resource from my computer which is on comcast what happens is i access that resource directly from my computer at home and the resource says safari online says i don't know who you are i don't recognize your ip number what's your credit card number so that doesn't work unless you buy a personal account obviously if you create a personal uh safari online account and pay for it with your own credit card that they'd be happy to do that but you can't use the stanford access because you're not a stanford computer so what we're going to do here is instead of accessing our restricted resource directly instead we're going to access it through the proxy server so we will send our request to the proxy server the proxy server will send the request onto the restricted resource the restricted resource will look at the iep number where that request is coming from it'll say oh it's coming from our proxy it doesn't necessarily know it's processor but it says oh it's coming from a stanford ip number because the proxy server is a stanford ip number the stanford server is on stanford campus and it says okay that's fine and so it will send the results back to the proxy server and the proxy server will go ahead and send the data back on to me so um stanford does run a proxy server and this is how you can access a variety of different resources uh what are some other uses of proxy servers well um i mentioned earlier about working for a company that did not want us to use computers for personal purposes another thing that that firewall can do is it can block access to things like sports illustrated or like let's say there's the stanford cal games going on and you're stuck at work and you're working over the weekend you're like i feel like i should be able to access this anyway well what you can do and be super careful about this because um i t can get really pissed off and your company can get really pissed off so don't do this and unless you're sure your boss is okay with it uh you know if it's if you're working over the weekend they might be okay with it um anyway so what you can do is you can work with a proxy server and send your request to watch the game through the proxy server and have the proxy server forward your request onto espn and then get get around the restriction not being able to access espn directly that way um this also used to be used to get around the great firewall of china and so the idea would be china blocks access to basically anything that makes the government look bad so they don't want you to be able to read the new york times and i want you to be able to read the washington post for example so if you were in china you used to be able to get around that by sending the request to get to new york times not directly because you sent it directly the the computers controlling access in and out of china will look at and say you're not allowed to access new york times so what it would do you would do instead is you would access a proxy server and say proxy server can you send a request out of new york times and then the proxy server would access new york times new york times would send the articles to the proxy server and the proxy server would send it back through and as long as the great firewall of china was not aware of that particular proxy server would not notice the ip numbers being a problem whereas if it saw the ip address for new york times i'd be like that that's not allowed but unfortunately the great firewall of china has gotten more and more sophisticated and so this is generally not going to work anymore um another issue with the proxy server is that the traffic is not encrypted so whether you're trying to get around the great firewall of china or you're trying to get access to espn because you're working over the weekend and you want to listen to the game big game in both cases that request is going to go in what's referred to as clear text so uh if the firewall is smart enough it can go ahead and look and say hey i see that you're sending this to this ip number i don't know about that's not espn.com but if i scan the text of your request i can see that there's a reference to espn.com in here what's going on anyway so that is a potential excuse with proxy servers but you know for things like accessing the resources that stanford is paid for when you are off campus proxy servers work great okay um a more sophisticated situation happens with virtual private networks uh and vpns can be used for some of the same things as proxy servers but they can also be used from some other purposes as well so um let's say uh we have a company it has the company intranet and um that's basically all the traffic in the corporate intranet and remember an intranet is an internal network that uses internet protocols all the traffic in the corporate internet is uh we're not worrying about that traffic we're assuming that there is no nobody inside the corporation that is doing something they shun that's trying to steal our data our information but we are concerned with all the information outside and that's why we have that firewall computer out there now suppose um we set up a different office in a different location um usually i use hong kong as my location but given the current uh situation in hong kong right now they may not be the best example but um yeah all right let's say let's use tokyo let's say we set up an office in tokyo and so now the question is we've got a palo alto office and we got our corporate internet in palo alto and then we have a corporate internet over in tokyo how are we going to connect the two together and what happens when data is sent from one office to the next office well the safest thing we can do if we're really concerned with security is we lease our own private lines and the only way somebody can actually eavesdrops in our conversation is to physically tap into the lines now clearly that that is technically possible but uh to physically tap into the lines depending on how sophisticated our attackers are but yeah that's that's going to take a fair amount of work otherwise if we don't do that what's going to happen here is when we send information from say the palo alto office the tokyo office we're going to just use the internet to send the information because that's by far the cheapest thing to do renting our own lines or worse yet laying our own lines it's going to be super super expensive so we're just going to use the internet but here's the thing let's say we've got two computers sending information through the internet one's in our palo alto office and one's in our tokyo office and so what do people outside of our company c when that traffic gets sent well they see everything because it's all being sent with ip packets and if somebody is between our computer and the computer we're sending it to they have to be on that chain or that sequence of computers that our iep packets get sent through they're going to see everything they're going to see who the sender is they're going to see who the recipient is and unless the contents are explicitly encrypted they're going to be able to see the contents as well now one thing you could do is you could just encrypt all the information but um it's possible just simply knowing whose computer is sending information to whose computer they may be able to get a lot of information so for example they know that the co is sending a lot of uh packets to the computer uh owned by an acquisitions director they might be like oh that company's about to make an acquisition let's see how we can take advantage of this so what you really want to do is one you want to make sure that people can't identify which specific computers are sending data to which other specific computers and then two in addition you want the data to always be encrypted instead of having to have the people explicitly encrypt their data and so a virtual private network's going to actually handle both of these and the way this is going to work is with the virtual private network when i sent information from a computer in one part of the network to a computer in the other part of the network my information is going to pass through a computer in the dmz and that computer is going to encrypt all the information it's not only going to encrypt the actual data i'm sending it's also going to encrypt the the ip number of the sender and the ip number of the recipient it's going to replace the ip number of the sender with itself and it will replace the ip number of the recipient with its equivalent dmz computer on the other side um and so then what we're it's going to do is it's going to go ahead and send that th that packet to the other dmz computer in the tokyo office the dmz computer in the tokyo office is going to decrypt all the information thus revealing the original sender and the original recipient and uh decrypting the information in the packet and then it will get passed on to the uh the actual destination computer so as far as what people on the internet are able to see they'll see that the two dmz computers are communicating so they'll see that the tokyo office and the palo alto office are communicating but they won't know which specific computers are communicating they won't be able to identify like what type of communication is taking place it's another thing that uh potentially people could see with the other the other without the vpn it's like what sort of communication is this and they won't be able to see the contents at all so uh big win um so in addition to allowing us to connect two different offices as if we had one big network without having to worry about what happens when the information travels through the internet not having to worry about the security there and this can also be done with the individual computers so you know if i'm operating from home or uh i'm out on the road i'm operating from my hotel the way this would work is my computer would bundle everything up and encrypt it and then send it to the computer in the office in dmz and then would be decrypted there you may also hear about private vpns this is a currently a relatively hot topic um and so why would somebody want a personal vpn or well i think probably the main reason why people are getting these is it hides your internet activity from the internet service provider or any other nefarious parties that are out there um and so the idea here is that uh one of the reasons why you might want to do this is it turns out that the trump administration has changed the rules so that our isps like comcast can now sell our web browsing information to whoever wants to pay for it now most of the major isps have promised they won't do that although well actually i suppose i was going to say although given the current circumstances they may not be doing well financially they may change their mind and that is always a possibility although i would see i would assume that under the current circumstances internet service providers are probably doing pretty well i mean you got to pick a business to be in uh being in a business that supports people working from home is probably a good business to be in anyway so uh bottom line is they are now allowed to sell information on all your internet habits um most of the main internet service providers have promised they won't do that but they are now legally allowed to do that so maybe you don't want that to happen and so uh if you contract with a vpn what will happen is um as far as comcast sees or you know att or whoever your provider is they'll just see you're communicating with a vpn what the ultimate server that you want to talk to is that's hidden from them they just see encrypted packets going from you to your vpn personal vpns can also be used to simulate being in a different country so if the vpn has connections in different countries you can say oh i want to connect to the vpn and pretend i'm in tokyo or i want to pretend i'm in australia um and so what will happen is your information will get bundled up but we get sent to the vpn and and the vpn will have a server in australia or a server in tokyo or wherever why do you want to do this well one thing it can be used for is in some cases you can access information that's regionally logged so uh this doesn't work with everybody um so you should poke around and do your research uh to make sure that the resources that you're looking for will allow access by vpns and my impression is some vpns do a bit better than other vpns but now like maybe there's a tv show you really want to watch and it's available in europe but it's not available in the us and if you try and access directly from the u.s they say hey that's a us ip number we aren't licensed to uh to show this uh to people in the united states um so if your vpn will allow you to pretend that say you're in italy and then you just connect to the vpn as far as the service provider sees you're coming from italy it's like okay that's fine i can go ahead and show you this show issues with vpns is kind of related or the vpns can get blocked by various websites or by various streaming services so it's possible for the streaming service to be like this is a vpn um this seems kind of sketchy i wonder if you're trying to get around our regional locks i am not going to show you any video also some financial websites will block you and this is basically because they know vpns hide where the information is coming from and they're like you might be a hacker this looks kind of sketch i'm only going to let you in if you are coming from a service provider that i recognize is normally legitimate like say a t verizon comcast something like that another issue with vpns is there's a greater chance that you are going to run into those annoying captchas where you have to type in words or you have to click on you know click on the crosswalk things um and that is again because the websites are are like you're coming from a vpn this is potentially much sketchier than if you're coming from a regular service provider i want to make sure that you are a actual human being not a computer trying to hack the website or a computer trying to perform a distributed denial of service attack so you know prove to me that you're human being so um while vpns do have some advantages personal vpns do have some advantages they can also cause some problems okay what else can you do well if you want the maximum security for your computing system you should just use an air gap and air gap is the term we use when a computer is completely disconnected from the network so there's a physical well this worked better before there was wi-fi there's a physical gap between your computer and the internet and uh this also means you shouldn't have wi-fi or bluetooth or anything else that allows you to remotely access it so just provide an example let's say stanford was super concerned about protecting the stanford grades what could they do well they know that there are all sorts of people at stanford various stanford students who could be probably pretty good hackers so they're like we're going to prevent access to the grade database from anywhere on the internet it's just going to be completely separated maybe it's got its own little internal intranet but that intranet is completely separated from the wider internet and there's no way to cross that gap without physically showing up and then what we're going to do is put guard dogs around let's say we'll put an old union in the basement old union we'll have guard dogs will have you know mean looking people around there and you know so we're going to prevent any access to this computer and the only way you can access the great computer is if you show up you show your identification card to the guards um they hold the dogs back um my dog right now is sleeping on the floor completely not paying attention which is probably good because you probably heard her barking a fair amount um and so that provides pretty good security because you know somebody needs to physically be there and again just emphasize you can't use wi-fi right uh if you if you allow wi-fi access and somebody just drives their van near the uh near the building and they have a bunch of hackers there with laptops and they access the wi-fi network so no wi-fi at all so what's the flip side of this the flip side is it's a real pain to get anything done with this so back in the old days when i submitted everybody's grades we really had these bubble like scantron sheets and we have to fill in all the scantron details and then we would hand them over to the departmental admin and uh he or she would take it to the main administration building and they would read it in so you know air gaps give me maximum protection and also provide the maximum amount of inconvenience okay um we talked about problems with email and there are a number of secure email systems that are out there it's just that's not what most people use um one thing to keep in mind when you are looking at secure email systems is that there are a variety of potentially competing objectives for secure email systems so one thing we want is confidentiality i think pretty much all of them want confidentiality which means that um you know people out in the wider internet can't actually see the email the email is encrypted when it's shopping through the internet but uh some of the systems want authentication so we want to know for sure who sent this particular email on the other hand um and that seems like a real obvious thing that of course don't all the systems want this well not necessarily because one of the reasons why you might want a secure email system is you know if you're a human rights activist or uh you know your whistleblower or something like that you want to be able to send emails securely to somebody but you don't necessarily want it to be easily identifiable who you are so in some cases you really want authentication in other cases you want really want anonymity and privacy and in fact some of the secure email systems really tell that they keep no record of the ip addresses of the people who are sending the information um so again depending upon what you're doing you might really want that ip address to verify that this person really is who they say they are or you might want a system where no you know if you're a whistleblower go ahead and send me an email like maybe i work for the washington post i want a system where people can go ahead and feel free that they can send information to me and it will be completely confidential one issue that comes up is who has the ability to decrypt the information is the information decrypt on the server does the server have access the keys so these are all issues that can come up particularly in situations where you know maybe you're in a country where you're concerned with you're sending information about things that should not be going on or human rights violations and you're concerned that the government will figure out who you are and uh come down on you and so these are different things that you you can be concerned about you might be concerned about like if that information is on the server and they get a subpoena are people going to be able to decrypt the messages or is that completely safe because they even the company storing the data does not have the keys to decrypt it okay um i mentioned this a couple times before but uh you know be aware that there's http which is the standard version of http and then there's https which is a secure version with with the standard regular http data to and from a web server is sent in what's referred to as clear text that means it is not encrypted with https traffic to and from the servers encrypted some web servers don't encrypt all related data and so most often i think the the uh the images might not be encrypted um sometimes the css might not be encrypted and this may trigger a warning from your web browser so your web browser may say hey you've got an https connection but be aware that it's not all being encrypted so typically that's going to mean that there's some some of the additional items associated with the web page and may not be encrypted it also could mean like maybe there's a a iframe we talked about iframes last lecture you know i mean so i mean there's a variety of different situations so ideally you you you don't want that to happen you want everything to be encrypted um and so along the same lines some websites support both http and https but they don't use https because it's expensive basically that encryption is expensive it requires processing power and so they say we're not gonna actually i don't know what that means all right that was fun whatever i just said triggered siri um so encryption is uh expensive it takes processing power to actually encrypt things and so that increases their cost because that means they need more computing power and so uh that's one of the reasons why they won't necessarily encrypt everything one thing that you may want to get is there's a plugin from the eff foundation called https everywhere and this plugin will force use of https when it's available so it'll basically be like no i really want https and as long as https is available on server all the information will be sent with https another thing you might want to do is disable javascript it turns out that um so for a while i had a security phd student who was my ta for cs105 and this was one of his biggest suggestions he said you know if you want to be safe computing on the internet and the biggest thing that you can do is you can disable javascript so the issue here is client-side javascript can be used in a variety of different malicious ways you know like we talked about the the drive-by download that's often triggered by javascript um sometimes there's uh holes in the web browser security that javascript can concern manipulate so basically disabling javascript will greatly increase your security on the other hand it will also make life potentially pretty annoying it makes things annoying because many web pages require javascript for actual use and so i'll show you the tools in just a second but a bunch of these tools will allow you to white list certain websites so you can say well when i'm on the new york times i trust new york times to not do anything they shunt so i'm gonna go ahead and put that on the white list um i would say definitely if you go to any sketchy websites uh ever you should turn off javascript and even if you aren't going to sketchy websites it turns out occasionally the standard advertising networks will somehow allow somebody to put up stuff out as advertisements on the standard advertising networks that uh use javascript to do some catchy stuff so that's that's kind of problematic um so i actually do disable javascript for web browsing but again it is kind of a pain but you know that was that was the number one recommendation from my security expert so uh okay so how do you actually do this there's a bunch of plug-ins the plug-in for firefox is noscript and i believe safescript is the plugin for chrome and the way this is going to work is when you go visit a particular web page if that web page has javascript associated with it the javascript won't run sometimes this will end up just giving you a blank web page most notably i think forbes will not allow will not even display anything if you're writing javascript because they're using javascript for their advertising anyway so what you need to do is there's going to be a little indicator telling you that javascript is blocked and so you can kind of look at that little icon and see how much javascript associated with web page is being blocked and then what you can do is if you click on it it will provide a list of the actual javascript files that this web page is trying to access and you can turn some of them off and turn some of them on and so you'll be like well clearly i need to allow canvas to access javascript but i see there's this advertising network and you know i do know that sometimes the advertising networks do send some sketchy stuff uh another suggestion that some people have is to use no ads but i i don't feel comfortable with that because i do realize that there's a lot of these independent websites that's the only way they're paying their bills so i leave the ads on but if the ads are using javascript that gets a little bit sketchier and uh yeah anyway so um so this is the way no scripts or safescript works basically uh you can whitelist a bunch of these you could say oh um scripts that are coming from such a such a website that's always fine but otherwise i want you to ask i do recommend it but it is kind of a pain so one possibly like i actually run two web browsers like i have one web browser that i only use to access my bank uh and my email and that's it and then any other web browsing i either do on my ipads which again you know as i mentioned before i'm much less worried about the ipad because it is more of a walled garden uh it's harder for people to break out of that or i access it from a web browser that has no scripts on okay another issue that comes up multi-factor authentication um the idea of multi-factor authentication is when you're logging into a website in addition to knowing your name and your password you should have some additional factors and so what are these different factors well one factor is something that you know that would typically be your password another potential factor is something you have such as a cell phone or uh some sort of security token another possible factor is something you are like this is you or yourself but like you have a fingerprint you have your retinal pattern so something that's unique about you because of who you are um and so the idea is you should have at least two of these in order to access a um a website or you know a remote resource it's the idea here is if your password leaks and somebody has your name and your password unless they have this extra factor here um they won't be able to access your uh your information or your banks or banking accounting or whatever so i strongly recommend on any website that you can you turn on multi-factor authentication particularly email remember your email is your keys to everything if somebody gets access to your email account ultimately that means they also has access to your your financial information because your financial information is probably tied to your email account i can go ahead and reset the password and bang it'll send it new password information to uh to your email so your email is the key to everything keep that super super secure and then of course financial websites um and so typically email and financial websites will allow you to turn on two-factor authentication i strongly strongly recommend you you do it the most common two-factor authentication is sending a text message to your phone so going back to what we said before you know something you know your password but in addition something you have you have your cell phone uh therefore it's not a hacker because they wouldn't have your cell phone um they might be able to get your password somehow but they won't have your cell phone now there is a bit of a problem with this because it turns out the sms system is not secure that's the text messaging the standard text messaging system apple internal imessaging is much more secure than the standard cell phone messaging system sms traffic is not encrypted and it's possible to spoof the system and to pretend to be something that you aren't so that's kind of problematic in addition hackers and scammers have started stealing people's telephone numbers so basically they claim to be you and get a new phone and get that phone directed and have cell phone messages to your phone actually sent to that new phone instead of to your cell phone so that's all pretty problematic um on the other hand you know if if this isn't a determined attack or trying to attack you specifically this is somebody who got a list of a whole bunch of passwords from somewhere um this will still probably be pretty good so you know if your choices are do this text messaging based two-factor authentication or no two-factor authentication at all do the text-based two-factor authentication it's way better than not having two-factor authentication so what's the alternative well some websites support a additional alternative method of multi-factor authentication using something called an authenticator now this can be a physical device that displays numbers on it at random intervals or it could be a cell phone app they both basically do the same thing and so they are creating what are referred to as pseudo-random numbers so they look like they're random numbers but they aren't actually random numbers uh what they actually are is they are a sequence of numbers generated based on a seed number and so as long as you start with the state's same seed number you will receive the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers after the initial seed and so the idea here is if your cell phone app or your physical authentication device starts with the same seed number as the web server that you're trying to communicate with you will both be able to generate the same sequence of numbers that look like they're random but they're actually pseudo-random and they will match exactly um now it turns out that uh the websites actually use a slightly different technique combining both this idea of a pseudo-random number along with the current time um but it's basically the same sort of idea you start off with the seed there's a sequence it takes the seed that's the sequence and the current time into account and based on that it can generate a number and it will be the exact same number as somebody else who started off with the same seed and knows what the current time is and so that's the way these work and the idea is that only you have that seed and the web server has that seed and if some hacker has your account even if they've stolen your telephone number but hopefully not your phone then uh you know those those numbers will uniquely match and there's no way somebody else that didn't know what the random the initial random seed was uh would be able to reproduce it um it's also possible to use biometrics um this was the something you are that we saw with the the possible factors so something you know something you have or something you are um so this could be like fingerprints or retinal eye pattern security experts seem kind of like not so hot on this idea i have heard some people say well if it's an additional factor that's fine but it should not be the only factor and so one of the problems is that you can't change it so like once your retinal eye pattern is out there it's out there um once somebody knows what your fingerprint looks like they know what your fingerprint looks like and you know it's potentially possible to fake out these systems if you know what fingerprint looks like um and so uh just as an example of how your fingerprints get out there well the united states office of personal management this is the bureau that's responsible among other things doing security checks got hacked and over 21 million people's fingerprints were stolen so great and i know i have fingerprints that are registered with the state of california because i teach high school students during the summer so everybody that teaches summer school you need to get your fingerprints registered um and so you know do i trust uh i i don't know where they're being stored i don't know whose response their storage but like do i trust them not to get hacked do i trust them not to get hacked enough to trust my bank account to them so uh that is the problem with biometrics okay some things to be thinking about as far as your passwords go there's a number of possible concerns with passwords the first one is passwords can be brute force so this means trying all the possible combinations and it's been interesting watching as people go like oh eight character long passwords are fine no now you need nine character long passwords and basically what's been going on here is the faster and faster computers get the less amount of time it's going to take for somebody to uh try all the different combinations anyway longer passwords are better than shorter passwords because each additional character requires you know a huge number of additional uh possibilities and so they need to try a lot more if they're doing a brute force attack in addition if you use both uppercase letters and lowercase letters again that increases the number of possible combinations if you include digits and punctuations not all websites allow you use punctuations which is kind of annoying but if you use digits and punctuation that will even more greatly increase the number of combinations so you want to maximize the difficulty of somebody guessing your password by just brute forcing trying all the different possible combinations uh use uppercase letters lowercase letters digits and punctuations um also you know i said the main thing is the length of password but uh attackers also have a list of the most common password used so like don't come up with something really cutesy that like maybe other people also use because that's probably on the list of the most common passwords and these are things that the attacker will try first use different passwords for different websites why well the first thing is like if you've got a bunch of random hobby websites uh do you know who owns that website do you trust two onsen website do you trust them one to not be a hacker but also two do you trust their computer security are they going to keep their computer security updated so just just to provide you an example um one of my passwords is out there in the wild there are lists that you can use to check and see if your passwords are out there and it turns out it got uh stolen from a website called titanquest.net titan quest was a video game similar to some of you may have seen diablo or play diablo it's kind of like diablo except for a little bit more classic greek uh greek themed um and yeah so i created an account on that website and they got hacked and that password is out there in the wild um and even professional websites do get hacked for example the playstation network a while back got hacked there have been a variety of other people that have gotten hacked so um ideally if they know what they're doing if they get hacked hopefully your password should still be protected because it's referred to what's called um hashed but uh but you know they don't always do don't always follow good safe competing practices so if they get probably increases the chance they're gonna get hacked if they're already uh not providing safe competing practices and then they get hacked and that password is now out there and in fact stanford says you should not use the stanford password on any other website but you definitely want different passwords like do not use your financial passwords on a random website a really bad idea and again reminder your email account is the key to the kingdom so you know don't use that password or anything else either some experts suggest using a passphrase instead of a password and so a passphrase is essentially a bunch of words strung together um so uh the idea here is that past phrases are easy to remember so like if you're like uh i don't know cardinal computer flomo hopefully you can remember that because floma is the best dorm on campus and obviously cardinal's really great and i already forgot what my middle word was but it's easier than a random sequence of 12 uppercase lowercase digits punctuation and the idea here is that what you can do with the passphrase is you can make the passphrase a lot longer uh so you know if you've got 12 random characters versus you have a sequence of four words typed together which end up being 25 characters well 25 characters is a lot of random combinations to come up with and since there are over 50 000 words in the english language even if they know that there are four words there's a heck of a lot of combinations in order to do that unfortunately research has shown that past phrases aren't as random as they should be this is from bonaire and chatova i i mentioned bonane shatova because joe bonet uh was a former student who i wrote a letter of wreck the god of grad school and i ran into uh i was reading up my passphrase and i ran into his research i was like go joe anyway so basically what they found was that uh people are not coming up with random passphrases they're coming up with phrases that fall specific rules they're grammatical rules they're you know and so the idea here is that if the past phrases are not actually completely a sequence of four completely random uh words then you are not getting full advantage of the idea that past phrases are longer but they're safer and in fact it greatly reduces the security on passphrases i think they're still generally considered even if you have four not completely random words um i mean if you come with a common phrase you're screwed but uh in general if there are four semi random words um you still should have pretty good security but just be aware you really want to pick stuff that's completely random you don't want to be like oh this is a cool set of words that completely make sense together that other people might also come up with that's that's a really bad idea okay now the possibility is a password manager so password manager is going to keep track of all your passwords uh it will come up with new passwords for you which are completely randomized and are of nice good length um and the basic idea here is you have a master password that gets into the password manager and then once you've done that you don't need to remember any of your other passwords um password managers are also really nice because they protect you from phishing attacks you recall you know phishing attacks is when you get something like an email claim to be for your bank you click on it it takes your website that looks exactly like your bank what the password manager is going to do is it could be like uh your bank is bank of america this is bank or america it looks really close but it's a different name i'm not going to enter in your password information here now what you need to do is if well first of all don't ever click on the links that's still true whether or not you're running a password manager or not but like um you know if you go to a website that you think you have a password for in your password manager and it doesn't get filled out automatically you should double check and be like huh i wonder why my password manager doesn't like this like is it that i misspelled it and this is a hacker's website or like what's going on here so i do think that this is a big advantage of using the password managers that they should help prevent phishing where somebody's trying to act like it's a website that you know in order to get your login information because the password manager is going to be like that's not the right website i have the password for the real website and that is not the real website and i'm not going to autofill in the information where if you're glancing at that website you might be like well it looks like my real website i guess i'm going to go ahead and type my information in password manager won't do that the one potential downside is the password managers there are a there have been a number of security incidents with password managers including one of them which got completely hacked so i don't know if there's any great solutions but um but the security experts do seem to think that the password managers are a good idea in general so uh you know i tend to listen to the experts on this all right um so there's one last lecture on security which is going to be super short which is just going to be a quick summary of uh suggestions for personal security including some of the ones that we just covered here on passwords i'll talk to you all soon
