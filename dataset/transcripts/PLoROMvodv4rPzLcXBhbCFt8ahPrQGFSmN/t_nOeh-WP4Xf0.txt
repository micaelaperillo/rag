welcome to exploring computing today's video is digital music part four digital data versus analog world this week we've looked at a number of differences between what happens in the computer and what we're used to in real life so the first difference that we saw was that we're used to using decimal numbers but the computers use binary numbers but the second difference is the difference between analog and digital now we went over the difference between binary and decimal first and the concept of binary numbers really does pervade computing we see this when we're out trying to purchase a phone and we see we've got choices of 64 128 256 or 512. we've seen this as we've discussed our digital images where we see that colors come in 24-bit color or 32-bit color and with our sounds where we have 16-bit samples and so i covered it first because it is necessary to have a better understanding when we're talking about images or sound but really the second difference the difference between digital and analog is probably far more important of the two i haven't explicitly talked about the difference between digital analog even though that's really what we've been doing these last two lectures the electron images and electron sound and so in this video i really want to explicitly talk about analog versus digital so analog refers to continuous signals when we're looking at the real world the real world is filled with continuous quantities in contrast what digital means is we're storing information in discrete quantities and so really what digital images is all about and what digital music or digital sound is all about is taking the real analog world and converting it into these discrete quantities which we can store inside the computer so there's always this process when we want to move something into the computer we have to take that real world analog entity and all its glory and somehow convert it to the digital world you know if we're looking at a picture so here's a here's a photograph of the red hoop fountain in front of green library you know let's say we're actually standing there in front of the library and the world with all its glory is out there and so we can ask questions like well how many colors are there in the real world how many pixels are there in the real world these questions don't make sense the real world does not have a discrete number of colors it does not have discrete pixels and so what happens when we take a digital photograph is we're converting it from the real world into these discrete units that can be stored inside of our computer we're converting the real in the real world into individual pixels and for each of these individual pixels we're taking a look at the color and we're saying hey you know i need to convert that color into the sequence of eight bits for red eight bits for green and eight bits for blue and so i'm digitizing the real world so that it can store it as discrete quantities inside the computer where i can start in these individual bits and bytes similarly when we're looking at our music when stanford symphony orchestra is playing beethoven's fifth symphony out in front of the classroom they are not generating a stream of numbers with forty four thousand one hundred numbers being generated per second and each number being between negative thirty two thousand seven hundred sixty eight and positive thirty two thousand seven hundred sixty seven that's not what they're doing they're generating a continuous analog signal and what we need to do when we store that into our computer is we need to convert that continuous analog signal into discrete digital quantities so we can actually store them in the bits and bytes in our computer memory
