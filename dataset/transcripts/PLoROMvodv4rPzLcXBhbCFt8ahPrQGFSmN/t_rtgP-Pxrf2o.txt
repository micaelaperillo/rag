welcome to exploring computing today's video is additional python features so in this video we're going to take a look at a few other python language features that you might find handy in certain situations so the first one i wanted to talk about is how to do a multi-line statement so sometimes you have a line of code that's just too long to fit on a single line comfortably and in some languages you can just go ahead and split across the line you can just say oh this doesn't fit on the line i'm going to go ahead and put a character turn in the middle uh the language interpreter should figure this out and it turns out this does not work in python so if you do what i've done here where i've taken name equals and i put in a character term there and then i followed on the next line with input this is actually going to cause an error when you try and load it so that's no good so there's uh several solutions to this um the one that's universally going to be doable is you can go ahead and put a backslash at the end of your unfinished line so if i say name equals and then i have that backslash don't use the forward slash gotta be backslash got that backslash that tells python i'm not really done with the line uh go to the next line that's actually a continuation of the current line in addition you can use parentheses so uh if you've already got parentheses you've got like that input statement there i can go ahead and use the parenthesis for the input statement um you can also in in many situations like if you've got a mathematical format you can just put in parentheses wherever you want but if you've got an open parenthesis like here where i've got that input and then open parentheses python immediately realizes that it doesn't see a closing parenthesis on that current line so i must be spreading my statement across multiple lines and it will go ahead and continue processing lines the subsequent lines as if they were part of the original line until it sees that closing parentheses you can do the same thing with the square brackets so if you've got a list of items like you've got here um it sees that opening square bracket it sees a bunch of people on our team member list it doesn't see a closing square bracket it says oh uh you must want me to continue processing uh the next line and the next line until i see that closing angular bracket all right another issue that sometimes comes up is how to do what's called concatenating strings and computer science concatenating strings means to combine two strings into a single string and there's a variety of different ways to do this depending upon the programming language in python you just separate the strings by space and it automatically puts them together so i say hello space everyone it's going to combine that together into a single string hello everyone notice that it does not actually add a space into the hello everyone so again hello everyone so if you want a space either the hello string needs to end with the space or the everyone string needs to start with a space or you need to put in a third in the middle a quote with a space with a closing quote in between the hello and the everyone and that will combine to get you hello space everyone this can be useful when we have a really long string so here i'm using the stamp for motto i'm not going to attempt to read it i don't know german at all the stanford motto blah blah blah translates as the wind of freedom blows and so maybe that's a little bit too long to fit on a single line i want to put it across multiple lines and i'm going to do that by breaking it down into individual strings notice each of these strings at least the first three strings ends with a space so translates as space the stand for motto space dash space because remember if we don't put those spaces in there when these this string gets combined back together uh we're not going to have spaces so don't forget your spaces you may also notice that i don't have closing uh backslashes on the end of each of these lines and that's because i've got that print statement so i've got the print parentheses and so that immediately tells python that it should continue processing each of the following lines as if they were on the same line until it hits that closing parenthesis you can also use triple quotes for this so if you've got a long string and you don't want to bother putting quotes around all of them and you want it to go across multiple lines um you can just put a triple quote at the start and then a triple quote at the end and this will also work okay the last thing i wanted to mention in our short little video on additional python features is how you write a comment in python and so you'll recall that a comment is used when we want to convey information to other humans who are reading our code but we want it to be ignored by the computer so here the number sign is used by python and when for comments and when python sees the number sign it ignores everything following the number sign until the end of the line that's considered a comment that's the python thinks oh that's something for human beings i'm not a human being so i'm going to go ahead and ignore it here we've got a number sign defined variable so that whole line it starts with the number sign so that whole line is just going to get completely ignored by the computer computer's just going to be like oh this must be something that patrick wants for other people reading the code to know but i'm not a person i'm a computer i'm better than a person i'm a computer so i'm going to just ignore that line so it completely ignores that first line and then the next line total equals 0 number sign total number of students is initially zero it is going to process the total equals zero that's not behind a number sign but then as soon as it sees that number science says uh the rest of this line that's for humans i'm going to go ignore it so this whole thing number sign defined variables total equals zero number sign total number of students is initially zero is going to get treated by the computer as just total equals zero all right that's it for today we've got one more lecture on uh on python programming i'll see you soon
