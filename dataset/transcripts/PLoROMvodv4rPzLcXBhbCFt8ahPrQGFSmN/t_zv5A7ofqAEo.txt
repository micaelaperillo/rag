welcome to exploring computing today's video is big data so i've referred to big data previously in the last video and the basic idea behind big data is we can use processing power to extract useful information from massive amounts of data and as the cost of storing information is decreasing we're able to collect more and more data as our processing power is increasing we're able to more easily process it and it turns out that new techniques in artificial intelligence and specifically machine learning are giving us new ways to process large amounts of data and so big data is referring to this ability to process the large amounts of data that we didn't have previously those that study big data sometimes refer to the three v's of big data the first v is the volume of information how much information do we have the second v is velocity how quickly is that data arriving if the data is not arriving that quickly we can often process it in real time as it's streaming in however if there's too much information for us to handle we're going to need large storage facilities in order to store that information and then batch process the information at some later point in time the third v is variety how many different types of data are we dealing with um in general we can divide the data into two types structured data which is data that is easy for the computer to process so something like a table of information like say a past list of passenger manifests that's super easy for the computer to deal with it's already in a format that the computer understands in contrast unstructured data is much harder for the computer to process and this might be something like a video so suppose we have a video of people arriving and departing from a passenger terminal that obviously is going to take a lot of work on our first to process it and get some useful information out of it some researchers have added a fourth fee to the previous three v's and that is the veracity of the data and i think unfortunately our current environment this makes a lot of sense so how accurate is the information we're working with and how sure we have the data sources so i think particularly with things like deep fakes and uh poor actors like russian bot accounts say on twitter it becomes increasingly important for us to think about where our data sources are and what those data sources can tell us now you know obviously if you've got something like a russian bot account actually studying the russian bot accounts themselves with big data techniques can also give you some information but you do need to you know carefully think about what your sources of data are and what they mean uh one thing that big data can be used for is removing anonymity on data that is thought to be anonymous so in one example netflix released a set of data with the names removed and allowed different data researchers to work with that data and learn from it and it turns out that a group from the university of texas austin was able to remove the anonymity of the data what they did was they compared the data that netflix had provided uh with things like what different um people watching netflix had watched and uh back then we used to be able to give movies number of stars instead of just thumbs up and thumbs down on netflix and what they did was they compared the ratings provided in the anonymous data with ratings provided at imdb by various users and even if somebody only had a few ratings out at imdb they were able to match up imdb accounts with netflix accounts and on that basis they were able to figure out what different users at an imdb had actually watched netflix even though the imdb users had not intended to release their viewing habits out on netflix one famous use of big data is the target store's pregnancy detection story so this is coming from an article in the new york times and i've included a link to this article in your class notes so the background on the story is typically uh and this this uh background is from some research at ucla typically customers form habits and shop at the same stores for mundane items so if you're buying you know we all have to buy soap toothpaste trash bags and other items on a fairly regular basis and typically we're just going to buy them at the exact same stores all the time over and over and over again but those buying habits can change during major life events such as when we get married or when we buy a new house or something like that and it turns out one of the big event is of course having children so when somebody is having a child that's a big opportunity for stores to step in and try and change buying habits of of different people and in addition another nice thing about pregnancy from the starts point of view is new unexpected parents can be expected to buy lots of stuff i can also point out that the same thing is true of people buying a house you buy a new house and suddenly your expenses go up for a while because you realize you've got all the stuff that you need for the house that you never thought of before now as far as pregnancy goes um and childbirth goes there are official public birth records but everybody has access to them and so if you wait for the public birth records to come out you're going to be bombarding these parents with advertisements at the exact same time as everybody else is going to bombard them with information and so target wanted a way to get a jump up on their competitors and discover when people were pregnant before their competitors were able to from the poke birth records now in order to do this target actually had a bunch of key data sets that really helped them out the first thing is they had information on their the purchasing habits on some of their customers if you have a discount card for a different store those discount cards are used to track your information so the bargain is you're going to get a discount on purchases but in return the store is going to be able to identify your particular purchase patterns in addition they have other information for example they may have your age your marital status the number of kids you have and in the case of target they knew how far you lived from at the closest target store and had an estimate of salary so that was one data set target had and then the second data set that target had was people who had registered for the target baby shower registry so they had one set of information on the buying habits and they were able to identify specifically when some of those people were pregnant and have some idea on the timing there and so what they did was they took all the information and used big data techniques they were able to discover that pregnant women purchased large quantities of unsent lotions at the beginning of the second trimester they purchased supplements of calcium magnesium and zinc for the first 20 weeks and they purchased scent-free soap and extra large bags of cotton balls in total target was able to identify 25 different items that acted as pregnancy indicators they also learned some lessons about advertising basically they learned that if you send people advertisements filled with baby items they find that kind of creepy and so they decided they were better off mixing uh mixing advertisements so quoting from the article they were basically mixing in all these ads for things that we knew pregnant women would never buy so that the baby ads looked random we'd put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers as long as the pregnant woman thinks she hasn't been spied on she'll use the coupons there's another amusing anecdote from the story um a man walked into target outside of minneapolis and demanded to see the manager he was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter and he was angry according to an employee who participated in the conversation my daughter got this in the mail he said she's still in high school and you're sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant the manager didn't have any idea what the man was talking about he looked at the mailer and sure enough it was addressed to the man's daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants the manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again on the phone though the father was somewhat abashed i had to talk with my daughter he said it turns out there have been some activities in my house i haven't been completely aware of she's due in august i owe you an apology all right so another fine story about what computing can do i'll talk to you all again soon
