welcome to exploring computing today's video is creating web pages working with a web server so so far we've talked about how to write the html and css but we haven't really talked about how to actually get your files up on the web now for the most part we're not going to need to do this for our class but i think it's clearly something that's important if you actually want to create a real web page so it's definitely worth talking about so so far if you think about what we've been doing for our class if you think about what's been going on with homework you've been creating files on your laptop and you've been loading them into the web browser on your laptop and so we're really taking advantage of one aspect of how the web browser works so the web browser actually has several different tasks it understands how to use http to make requests to different web servers and then it understands when the files come back how to actually render and display those and we've only been taking advantage of rendering and displaying the files after they've been placed on our computer and we have not been taking advantage of the first part where we request files from a server we've been generating the files on our own laptop and loading them on our own laptop so clearly if we want to have other people be able to see our web pages we need to put the files on the server where they can be sent to lots of different people so what we need to do here is we need to basically reverse the process here we need to take the files the html the css the image files whatever files are associated with our web page we need to take those files from our laptop where we've been we've been playing around with them and experimenting with them and testing them then we need to actually put them on a server and so that's what this video is all about okay so there's a number of different steps and i will go over each of these steps in detail but let's just take a quick overview here okay we need to get a web hosting service so we need to have an actual server we can put those files on we need to create and test the files and testing them locally as you've been doing for the homeworks that's totally fine that is a common practice um but once we're convinced that the files seem to be working fine we need to figure out how to get them onto the web server so that's going to take several things first of all we need to choose the software we're going to use to transfer the files over to the server and then we're going to have to figure out where to put them on the server and then of course we're actually going to transfer them and then finally we should double check our files and make sure everything's working properly and we'll be spending some time at the end of this video talking specifically about things that can go wrong and things to be checking for okay so you need have a web hosting service um stanford provides hosting for student files so um every student at stanford has a directory that they can place files on that can be accessed from web.stanford.edu many internet service providers also provide web hosting so if you graduate from stanford you can check with whoever's providing your internet service they may provide hosting for files um there's quite a number of companies that also provide some basic web hosting services and then if you really get into it you can get professional grade web hosting like amazon web services all right so as i suggested um creating and testing files on your own computer is a great idea and that's what we've been doing here you can't test the files on an actual web server um and you know if we get a little bit more advanced and you may want to do some of that on your own files but uh the main thing to keep in mind is if you do transfer files over the web server and you have not tested them those files are live so you know people visit your website and you are in the process of testing your files to make sure they're working they're going to see stuff that's potentially busted so uh the way around this is you can have a special test location on your server and do some testing there or you can actually run a separate test server okay as far as file transfer software goes in general you're going to want a program that supports a secure file transfer protocol or sftp so there is an earlier version of this protocol just called ftp it's still usable but in general it's recommended you use the secure version sftp and in fact stanford will not let you connect to the stanford servers with ftp you need to use secure ftp these are a couple sample programs you might consider for using sftp securefx on windows or fetch on the mac and in fact these are both available for free to stanford students and faculty and staff and here's a website if you haven't already visited this website this is a handy website to know about it's called essential stanford software or ess you can go to it from ess.stanford.edu it'll make you log in with your su netid and there's a bunch of software there that you can download for free including secure fx and fetch for our sftp transfers these sftp programs are likely to work for any service provider that you're working with any web hosting solution that you're working with getting the files over there different hosting solutions may also have other ways of getting the files over there so for example stanford has a web interface if you go to afs.stanford.edu you can upload and download files using that website um our experience has been that in general the students do find it a little bit more straightforward maybe a little bit easier working with afs afs.stanford.edu rather than getting a separate secure ftp program but you know as you start doing more and more work you will probably find that there's more to learn and maybe it's a little bit harder getting used to sftp but once you understand how sftp works you may actually find that it uh that using it actually streamlines your process quite a bit so if you're just doing something simple like the homework files and using something simple like afs.stanford.edu would work fine but if you're working with a actual large website you're probably going to want to use something a little bit more sophisticated okay so uh we need to determine what location to put our files in and all stanford students as i mentioned before do have web hosting from stanford so stanford has a file server that you can use to store different files this is sometimes referred to as the leland system uh and in the leland system you've got a directory there and within that directory there's a special directory already created for you called www this is where you put your web page stuff so that that wwe directory if you put things into the www directory they are now on the web so don't put anything in the www directory unless you want other people to be able to see it because it is publicly available and the read write permissions are set so that anybody can view the files in that directory if you put something in the www directory people will be able to access it using the url i put here http colon slash web.stanford.edu tilde and then whether your su net id is and then if they just end it with a closing slash it will load the index.html as we talked about in a previous video that's the default at stanford loadingindex.html or if they follow the tildesu netid slash with the actual name of a html file that's what will be loaded up okay so we now have some idea of what our file transfer options are and we now know where to put the files as far as stanford goes um if you're working with a web server other than stanford whoever is providing your web hosting should tell you what location to place the files for uh web hosting okay so we're gonna go ahead and transfer the files over i'm showing you an image here of securefx in action and this basically has two sets of directions there's a set of directories and files on the left which is what's on my laptop and there's a set of directories and files on the right that show what's on the server and i've got a whole bunch of junk in here and you can actually see my www directory there has a whole bunch of sub folders in it um but you know if you haven't done anything you will have an empty www directory and i'm not going to talk too much about how to transfer files over it's going to vary depending on which software you're using and it's generally going to be pretty straightforward basically you can take items on the left and either drag them over to the right or often you can just double click over them on the right the other thing that i think is worth mentioning is you can either transfer individual files over or you can just transfer entire directories over so if you've got uh you know some sort of a fairly deep nested structure of files and folders for your website and you've got it up working on your laptop and you want to transfer them over to the server you don't need to transfer the individual files over you can just transfer the whole directory over and it should work okay once you get them over there um you know even if they work fine in your laptop you do want to do some extra checking once you transfer them over so if we're a professional probably what we're going to do is we're going to have a separate testing location other than where the files ultimately are going to end up or we're going to have a test server you may occasionally run it to these test servers um actually running on the web sometimes people just leave them up and even have links to them so if you see something that looks like this www.example.edu colon 8080 that is actually the test server that 8080 that's a port number um cs106e students who talked a little about port numbers being used to identify specific programs running on a particular computer on the internet and the normal port number for http is 80 and an 8080 is used as a test uh test server for http okay what sort of problems might you run into so i suggest that you should double check all your stuff once you move over to the web you can put in a temporary testing location and then rename the testing location when you're done you can put them in a temporary server location and then move them over when you're done or you know if it's just some fun stuff that you're putting on the web you can just put it in its ultimate destination not bother with the testing server stuff um and just assume that you know if it's just your friends that are going to be seeing it they're probably not going to happen to visit your website at the exact same time that you're putting the files up okay so what can go wrong why am i telling you to double check all your stuff well here's some common things that could go wrong first of all if you get a 404 error that probably means your files are in the wrong location or it could mean that you're misspelling something in the file name so those are well the misspelling is actually fairly common although if you test it thoroughly on the laptop before transferring over we'll actually take a look in a couple minutes about some issues with file names but hopefully you would have caught that if you get a 403 error remember that means permission not found that means that the permissions on the directory are messed up this used to be an issue at stanford because the www directories were not pre-created and students had to create them manually and if you didn't set the permissions right basically people visiting the directory would be there but people trying to visit from the web the server would say hey you don't have permission to view that file but at this point stanford does have that www directory already created for all students with the permission set properly presumably if you're working with an outside web hosting service they will set the permissions properly or you know if you're doing something really sophisticated like amazon web services well then it's up to you don't bring out the big guns and use the sophisticated services unless you know what they're doing they can get pretty complicated um amazon has a huge number of options and it can get very very complex very quickly all right i also recommend that you just double check every link on your website and double check your images and make sure that they're all working um what can go wrong well first of all don't use absolute references we've talked about this before when we talked about creating links and definitely don't use file references remember absolute references are references to specific locations on specific computers if you were testing on your laptop and you had absolute references and now you move it to your web hosting service like for example stanford those files are now in a different location so those absolute references are now absolute references to your original laptop they are not absolute references to the new location of the file so in general just don't use absolute references unless you're linking to somebody else's webpage in which case that other person's web page is still located wherever it was out on the web before it's still located there after you move your files over to stanford so that's not going to have an effect but as far as links to web pages within your website or references to anything within your website for example images within your website you need to use relative references for that okay i mentioned this a little earlier when we talk about four fours that there are some issues that can come up with file names uh here's what you're going to do to avoid those issues name your files with all lower case letters no uppercase letters just lowercase letters you can use the digits 0 through 9 you can use dashes and then just for the dot html or the dot css you can use the period that's all i recommend it is possible to use upper and lowercase letters but here's what can happen so it turns out when you're testing the files on your own computer like you created the files on your laptop you did some testing on your laptop laptops and some servers don't actually care if you get the case and the letters wrong so if you mix the upper and lower case letters that works just fine so if i've got a file named test.html with a capital t and i create a link to it using ahf equals lowercase t test.html that will work fine on some servers and it will generally work just fine when you're testing locally just on files on your laptop but some servers including stanford's are much more finicky and the upper and lower case must match so in this case if i had a file named test.html the capital t and i tried to link it to it with the lowercase t it wouldn't work it would show hey i don't know what that file is and keep in mind this happens with links this is also going to happen with things like if you've got an img with an src and the case is wrong on your src it's also going to just show up as a broken image so um i think you can get this to work as long as you're really careful and you always use the correct upper lower case for the names i think it's easier just to just not deal with that and just name all your files just lowercase okay i also mentioned that you should just use the dash you can use other characters but they will cause problems and there are some issues with them so you know i think one thing that you may occasionally run into for example is if somebody puts a space in the name of the file you can link to it but basically you need to replace the spaces in all of your references to that file with the percent 20. um that's actually a reference to the original ascii code for the space character so you know it's better to not deal with these percent 20 and co coatings uh these are sometimes referred to as url encodings uh and just you know just don't use any weird characters the dash does not need any special encodings obviously the letters don't need any special encodings neither do the digits zero through nine so just limit yourself to using those in in your name and that should solve a lot of problems okay another issue that i've seen students run into is having the wrong type of image format so here are the image formats you should be using you should limit yourself to jpegs pngs gifs and then we haven't really talked about this all i mentioned it very briefly there's something called svg which allows us to store images using an object slash vector remember those two are synonymous object or vector graphics format instead of the jpeg png gifs which are using the bitmap also sometimes referred to as raster format so we might talk about svg later in the quarter but you know regardless these are the four formats that you can use there are some other formats that you might commonly run into those will not necessarily work on the web so if you're taking images with an ios device for example apple has a new format heic it's a good format but it is not web compatible and even apple's web browsers if you were to serve a file up using this format they're not going to display it so don't don't use the heic format you need to convert it also google has been pushing this webp and webm formats one of them's for photos and one of us for movies um these are not supported by a little bit over 50 of the web browsers currently in use in the united states one of the big holdouts is it turns out that apple is not supporting it on their safari uh web browser so um i strongly don't recommend using either these formats so if you're using something with a format like heic apple's htic or webp you you are going to have to reformat your your information into one of these other formats jpeg png gif or potentially svg um i do want to caution you that you do need to use a photo editing program like say photoshop i have had some students just try and rename the files um and it would be nice that the computers were smart enough to handle that now but they aren't currently there yet so you know definitely use something like photoshop uh there's some built-in software [Music] windows and i suspect the mac as well have some built-in basic image editing software and they can pro probably do the transfer as well if you don't want to spring for photoshop okay so that gives you some ideas on how to take your files and put them up on the web um i guess the last thing i should say you guys have probably had this drilled into at this point but be cautious on information that you put up on the web uh everybody can see it um you know think very very carefully if you want to have your name and phone number up there i mentioned one of the earlier lectures about putting email up there that gets all scooped up by automated programs i haven't heard anything about automated programs looking for phone numbers and adding them to you know telemarketing calls but that would not surprise me and it certainly happens with email addresses that are put on the web and of course you know you want to be very careful about putting stuff like your home address and other information like that online all right so that's it for what you need to do in order to get your files actually online i'll talk to you in the next video you
