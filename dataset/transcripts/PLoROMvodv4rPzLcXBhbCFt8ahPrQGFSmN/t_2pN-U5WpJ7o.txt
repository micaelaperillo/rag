welcome to exploring computing today's video is creating web pages adding tables so tables show up in a wide range of places if you're writing a paper for class and you're writing a paper on economics or history there's a good chance you might need a table if you're in the fine arts and you're creating a new web page for a new play you're putting on you may want to put up a table of performances or if you've just created a new non-profit and you want to put up a schedule or a directory of volunteers you're going to need a table so in this video we're going to teach you how to put tables on your web pages so we're going to use this as our example table it's uh as you might guess from looking at it it is the score from uh one of the big games stanford 21 cal 3. now since this is html and everything's done with tags as you might guess there's a table tag and in addition to table tag there's a table row tag and so we're going to enter in our information by rows and within each row we're going to create table data items or tds there is a table column tag but you cannot enter in data by columns you can only enter in data by rows the column tag is only used for formatting and we're not going to cover it in this lecture okay so i've got my table i've got a couple table rows i've entered my data to my cells am i done well it turns out i'm not if we were to take the html we've got displayed here and we were to put it on our web page instead of getting this nice table on our left which is our target we're actually going to get the table on our right which doesn't exactly look like a table and so as you might guess what we need to do is we need to go in and add in some cascading style sheet information okay so the first thing i need to do is i need to say that my table data items should have borders and so i'm going to give it a one pixel solid black border just a reminder when you're working with borders don't forget that solid um if you just say one pixel black it's not going to be enough you have to say it's solid and i've given a five pixel padding which gives me some space between the words stanford or california and the surrounding borders but as you can see from the top right that's what we get with this particular style we're still not quite there yet that looks a little bit odd and it turns out and i'm not sure why they did this but it turns out that the solution to this is you need to add in a second rule specifically on the table and we need to say that the border collapse is set to collapse basically just copy it as written here and do note that this is on the table this is not on the table data items okay so one thing that commonly shows up on tables is you have table headings and then you have standard table entries and the difference between the headings and the table entries is the headings are in bold and in html they are also centered so to do this we use the th tag instead of the td tag you can see i'm using the th here both in the style sheet don't forget you need to have style rules for the th just like you do for the td and also in the html the only difference between a td and a th is the th has a predefined setting with bold and centered other than that the two are basically work the same arguably the th is also important because it does have semantic information is for in the web browser that that is the heading um and uh you know that could be used for a variety of different purposes um including for web browsers that are reading to somebody who's visually impaired and potentially computer programs that are processing web pages like say the google search bot might be able to do something knowing that something is a th instead of a tv all right now you may have noticed i've been using stanford and california instead of stanford and cal and that's because we use stanford and cal this is what we get and one can argue that that is the correct proportions having stanford nice and big and cal being small but it does lead to a rather odd table so what i'd prefer is something like this and i can do that just by adding a width onto the different items and in fact there's a wide range of different things that you can do with the cells meaning the th's and the tds and so here are some examples of some changes i've made so i've set vertical alignment top and text alignment to left on the stanford th i've set cal with the text line to right overriding the th's center alignment and then you can see i put heights and widths on all the cells all right if we want to get fancier we've got some other things that we might run into so here i've got some data on stanford geographic origins of the undergrads and grad students and if you look at that geographic origin notice the geographic origin actually goes across multiple columns so how do i handle that well there's a attribute value pair for the html called column span or call span and basically i just need to use that so here's the source here you can see that instead of having three th's for that geographic origin i have a single th and i said column span equals to three and it just goes across all three of the columns you may also notice if we go back to our output here you'll notice that there's a line between the empty left-hand top cell and the empty cell just below it and we might want to get rid of that and we can do that by using row span so you can think of it as the problem being that we have two empty cells one on the top left and one in the second row on the left and so if i can combine those two cells into a single cell then i can get rid of that line and so i can do that using this row span and here's the source here you can see i have that th row span equals 2. notice how below it in the next row i start off with th california and so with th row span equals 2 in the first row i completely skipped that cell in the second row that th row span equals 2 extends across both the rows i do not list it in the second row and i start off with california and if you look at the image on the top right you can see i it does look much nicer all right so that gives you an idea of how to use tables on your web pages in the homeworks you'll get a chance to play with zebra striping which can make your tables look much nicer this is an example of a zebra stripe table
