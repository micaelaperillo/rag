welcome to exploring computing today's video is website design so in this video we're going to talk a bit about website design and i want to focus mostly on branding and the idea behind branding is you want to make your website unique and clearly identifiable and the idea here is if your website looks like everybody else's website people aren't going to notice it and let's say somebody emails a link to your website to one of their friends that friend visits that page says oh this is pretty cool and then the next day somebody else sends a link to another page on your website to that same person and what you want to have happen is when they click on that link you want them to say wait a minute i think i've been to this website before i recognize this website this is a different page but yeah this is the same website i went to yesterday this this website seems to have some really cool stuff i should be paying attention to this website and so in this video we're going to talk about some things that are going to help you make your website unique identifiable and interesting okay so here are the four elements of branding we're going to be talking about today we're going to be talking about logo briefly uh typography in particular font choices and color schemes and then i'll talk a little bit about uh overall layout and what you should be thinking in terms of navigation all right so the main thing i want to say about your logo is you need to make sure that your logo is clearly identifiable and appears on all your web pages or at least some version you can have a simplified version on the inner pages and then like a fancy version on on the main home page the thing to keep in mind here is that if you have a successful website people are going to be doing what's called deep linking and so that means is that people are going to be linking to individual pages deep within your website i think one thing that many amateurs often think is that oh i'm just going to focus on the branding on the home page because everybody's going to be coming through the home page and that is just not true you know if you think about web page links that you've sent to friends you know there's probably been many times when you've been like oh here's a particular product uh that's part of a larger website i want to go ahead and send somebody like this or here's a movie review you know and this is an inner page on a larger website and so this is deep linking and so always keep in mind and we'll talk about this again we're talking about navigation schemes that people are not necessarily coming through the front door so you know you need to have your website clearly identifiable from any one of the web pages all right so one of the key design choices you're going to be making for your website is what to use for fonts and we're going to be talking about three fundamental font choices and they are you can use a sans-serif font a serif font or a mono space font and as we'll see when we take a look at real web pages real web pages often use a mix of these but you know most of them are primarily either sansef or serif monospace is used for special purposes that we'll be talking about a little bit later all right so let's make sure everybody understands what these serifs are and what sans serif is so on the left i have a sans serif font and on the right i have a serif font and those little tick marks uh on the ends of uh the f here those are the serifs so here's what the design people will tell you about serif versus sans serif fonts serif fonts are formal and authoritative although the flip side of that view is serif fonts are old-fashioned and dowdy and sans-serif fonts are upbeat and contemporary so you need to think about what the purpose of your website is and whether you'd rather be contemporary or authoritative when choosing your font so let's take a look at some actual websites and see which one of these font choices they're making so what do you think do you think the new york times wants to be upbeat and contemporary or do you think they want to be authoritative okay so here's the new york times um we look at up at the top their actual title there that seems pretty seraphi and if you look at the news stories here you can see that they have serifs as well and there is some sans serif over on the right side that whole sidebar is largely sans serif and up at the top right underneath the name the new york times if you look at the world u.s politics new york business that's all sans serif as well and so we scroll a little bit further down the website you'll notice that this webpage is largely serifs and the news articles themselves are serifs and so that kind of makes sense if you think about like what's new york times probably trying to portray here they're trying to portray that they are formal and authoritative what about the washington post so the washington post also largely uh has a lot of serifs here um although again as with the new york times if you look at underneath the uh the title there that bar going across the top in the news coronavirus news dc outbreak and so on that sans serif um you can see some other places where they're using sans serif the writers of the articles those names are sans serif and if you look at the actual text uh of the articles here if you look at that center america's chronovirus divide and you look at the text there the question of whether or not the country should continue to stay at home that's actually sans serif all right what about msnbc so they're trying to be more contemporary uh i offhand do not see any serifs on this webpage at all so that kind of got me thinking like i think msnbc's uh rather left-wing and so is there a difference between how left-wing institutions and right-wing institutions portray themselves and so i thought we'd take a look at a couple think tanks here now the brookings institute that's the center left think tank and you can see that their name brookings there on the top left that has saris but in fact their website largely other than their name uh you know which may have been uh that that font may have been chosen quite a while ago now the rest of the website has no serifs at all and then the heritage foundation which is a conservative think tank you can see that this is largely a serif website there are some sans-serif portions so running across the top there about heritage event renewed donate press and contact those are sans serif but their logo itself the heritage foundation the top left and their main article here these all have serifs okay so based on what we know about uh font choices which type of font you think apple computer is going to use and here we go there are no serifs here on at the top of the apple page and if we scroll down even further you can see yeah the apple has no series at all there they want the contemporary upbeat look they are not interested in being old-school authoritative formal no not apple okay here's one more the mandarin oriental new york this is a five-star hotel in new york what font choice do you think they would have all right and so here you go uh this is largely serifs and there is some sans serif so if you look across the top there um their top bar does have sans-serif font and in fact if you were to click on the menu that also has sans serif but the new york as well as the rest of the website there all has serifs okay i mentioned monospace so let's talk a little bit about monospace so your primary choices are serif or sans-serif there is another type of font monospace and actually model space fonts can have serifs or they can be sans serifs in a mono space font all the characters are the same width so here i've got a non-monospace font and notice m i w i m notice that the eyes are much much narrower than the m's which you know that's kind of what you'd expect so uh this font where the ms and the i's are different sizes this is referred to as a variable width or proportional font [Music] in contrast here's a monospace font i've got m-i-w-i-m on the bottom there and if you look it's a little hard to tell for sure but you can kind of see that the eyes there are much wider so than with our non-monospace font so um m i w i m it looks like on the bottom font those eyes are much wider than with the non-monospaced font and in fact we can definitely see this if we reverse the letters here so here's our variable with font m-i-w-i-m followed by i-m-i-w-i both these quote words have five letters each in them and you can see that the second one because it has a lot of eyes which are super narrow is much shorter than the top one now we switched to a monospace font uh you can see that these actually are both the same width so that's the basic idea behind a monospace one all the characters are the same width amount of space fonts are typically used to either represent program code or computer output so if we've got a our html source i actually have not been using monospace for all of our code mostly because monospace fonts take up a lot of space but it's pretty common to use monospace for computer code and in fact if you look at an editor for example so here is here's visual studio code and the default setting uh on any one of these editors designed for programmer use is going to use some sort of a mono space font it just makes it easier to get everything all lined up okay so our next topic is choosing a color scheme and in order to understand how to choose a color scheme we actually need to learn a little bit more about color theory so we've been using red green and blue rgb and rgb is how the computer monitor actually creates colors but there are other ways to be thinking about colors and one of them is the huge saturation brightness or hsb scheme and that's the one we're going to be using okay so the first part of hsb is the hue and so the hue you can kind of think of hues as the colors of the rainbow that are the colors of the color spectrum and so that's what we're looking at here now in addition to choosing a hue i can also vary the saturation so what we're seeing here is that on the left i have full saturation and i'm reducing the saturation on the far right i have very little saturation and if i reduce the saturation enough i'm just going to end up with white in addition to controlling the saturation i can also control the brightness and so that's what we're seeing here on the far left i have maximum brightness and i'm getting less and less light and then on the far right i have no brightness which is basically black okay so as i suggested rgb that's how the computer display actually creates colors and hsb uh is a scheme that people often use to choose determine what their color scheme should be and so you may be wondering what is the relationship between the rgb and the hsb that we're showing you now and honestly it's there's just a simple mathematical formula to go from one to the other so you know we're not talking about creating different colors we're just talking about a different way to be thinking about colors so based on what we know so far one possible color scheme is to just choose a hue and then just to vary the color by reducing the saturation or increasing or reducing the brightness so this would be called a monochromatic color scheme and this certainly works and it's not going to look horrible but it may not look that exciting either so you know this may be not be the way you want to go for our other color schemes uh we want to understand a bit about how to choose the hue and typically we're going to choose the hue by using what's called a color wheel so let's go about creating a color wheel i'm going to start off with our three primary colors and remember on the computer we're using additive color so our three primary colors on the computer are red green and blue and what then what i'm going to do is i'm going to mix the colors i'm going to mix each color with the color next to it so i'm going to mix red with blue getting some form of purple i'm going to mix the green with the red and that will get me yellow and i will mix the green with the blue and that will actually give me cyan and by mixing each of the three colors with its nearest neighbor that gives us the six color color wheel and that's what we're looking at here and then i can do it again which will get me the 12 color color wheel and then i can keep on going as many times as i want and in fact if you were to take a look at adobe photoshop and and many other painting programs they have color wheels built in so uh the outer ring here what we're seeing is uh we're seeing the color wheel generated by over and over and over again mixing the colors with its nearest neighbor until we get a continuous range of colors here and then that triangle in the middle that is actually the saturation and brightness so the bottom left is no brightness and then the top left is no saturation and so you can kind of play around with how much saturation versus brightness you want to get okay so how are we going to use this color wheel to create color schemes well there's a number of different color schemes one can create using the color wheel one color scheme choice the simplest color scheme choices complementary colors in complementary colors we take a color on one side of the color wheel and then we choose a color on the immediate opposite side of the color wheel and so here we've got blue and yellow and if you have any friends or you've got a brother or sister who's in one of the university of california schools most of the university of california schools have some variation of this blue and and yellow color scheme so cal has dark blue and gold the colors we're showing here are pretty close to uc irvine colors now ucla i think has more of a powder blue and uh yellow or gold um so these seem to work pretty well on the other hand if you kind of look at what this thing should match up with our cardinal red well as far as i can tell this suggests that we should have some variation of cyan uh which i personally think that will look just awful so oh well but anyway this is how you create a complementary color scheme so another thing you could do if you want more than two colors you can use a split complementary scheme and so what happens here is i take a color on one side of the color wheel and i choose two colors on the opposite side of the color wheel and you can kind of play around with the angle between the two colors on the opposite side of the color wheel to get some different color schemes or you can have a triad color scheme where all three of the colors are equal distance across the color wheel or you can have an analogous color scheme where you're choosing colors that are near each other on the color wheel i mean you can kind of play around again with that angle there i've only got 12 colors so there's not a whole lot you can do with the angle but you know if you were to use that uh finer grain photoshop color wheel with a wide range of hues you can play around with the angles and get different analogous color schemes okay the last thing i wanted to mention is layout and navigation issues and so you know try to make sure when you're creating the web pages that uh you have a clear idea on how people are going to be navigating your website provide a clear sense on any single page on what else is available on the website and you know as i mentioned earlier remember if you have a successful website you're gonna have people deep linking to your web pages and so any one of your web pages should make it clear to whoever comes to visit that particular page that there's a lot of other stuff available on your website you should make it very clear how to get to the home page and have some idea give them some idea of what the other sections of your website are provide a consistent navigation scheme so they don't have to every time they go from one page to the next be like gosh i don't understand what i'm supposed to click on to go somewhere next and i don't have any dead end pages with no way out this is something that you know i've graded a lot of amateur websites over my time here at stanford and this is one of the things that i see a lot i see both often people will have web pages that where it's not clear how to get to that web page um and if we weren't actually counting up the files when we're trying to grade their project be like hey i've seen the other web page on the website look at they've got this extra html file here i wonder how i was supposed to get to that you know if it wasn't for the fact that we actually look at the html files we wouldn't you know we just completely miss it we start at the home page we visit all the pages that there's clear links to and then there's this extra page and you know nobody knows how to get to that so uh don't do that a page that is not clear to to people how to get to is pretty useless and similarly you don't want a page where somebody clicks on the page and the only way to get out of that page is to hit the back button because you know uh if somebody ends up deep linked to that page they're not going to be able to get away from that page there's not going to be able to find a way to the rest of your website so you know definitely don't do that all right so that's it for our little talk on website design you
