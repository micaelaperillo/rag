welcome to exploring computing today's video is computer security malware so we're going to continue our discussion on computer security and today's videos are going to focus on ways that you can be attacked and things that can be done to you and the next lecture will focus on ways you can protect yourself so i want to start off by talking about malware malware is basically the term comes from malicious software and this is software that can get installed on your computer and do some nasty stuff specifically we're going to talk about spyware ransomware adware how your computer can be turned into a zombie computer and placed in a botnet and then i'll also discuss logic bombs all right so let's start off with spyware spyware is software that has been installed on your computer that is designed to spy on you so we saw this with the dalai lama example from the previous lecture where uh the computers in its office were infected by something called ghost rat for remote access tool and connect to the ghost net i think the spyware is particularly problematic on modern computer and mobile devices because of the specific capabilities of our computers or mobile devices it's always been very problematic but i think now more than ever it's really a problem okay so what sort of things can spyware be used for well the first thing is it can be used to key log and so what this means is it's going to track all of your keystrokes so if you go to your bank for example it's going to keep track of your username as you type it in and then it will keep track of your password as you type that in as well and this information will all be sent over through the network to the attacking person um spyware can also copy files so for example if you've got information about financial information on your computer you can go ahead and take those files and send them somewhere remotely um now one of the things that it can do on a modern computer or a modern mobile device that they didn't used to be able to do is we all have microphones and cameras and so it can be used to turn on the microphone and listen to what you're saying in a room it can turn on the camera also because modern mobile devices keep track of your movements uh spyware can be used to track you all right ransomware when it gets on your computer what it does is it encrypts your entire solid state drive or your entire hard drive and it asks for payment to decrypt your uh information so basically locks your information and it requires payment typically in bitcoin in order to unlock your device um so an example of ransomware is the wannacry so this is a ransomware which uh was released in 2017 and it infected over 200 000 computers in over 150 countries uh it demanded bitcoin payments from 300 to 600 depending on how soon you paid it off and i took down large parts of the british national health service it caused so much disruption to the british national health service that the british health service was forced to turn away patients except for in critical situations this particular piece of software used an exploit that was known about in microsoft windows and so people that had updated their copy microsoft windows were protected and people that didn't were vulnerable to this attack it's believed to have been north korean origin although not known for sure um there's actually multiple uses of the term ad where um some people use it to just refer to any program that displays ads so for example so i have mirror webster app on my mobile devices and when you run it you can look up words for free it will read the words to you for free which i think is a glorious feature particularly for people learning foreign languages having dictionaries which can speak words to is amazing and i will say i do find it useful in english as well and you can use the merriam-webster app for free because it displays advertisements similarly i have the weather channel app on my mobile device and again uh you don't have to pay for it it displays little ads at the bottom of the app so some people do consider these adware i don't but you can certainly see where the term comes from i'm going to use the term adword to refer to software that is maliciously installed on your computer or surreptitiously installed on your computer that displays ads you do not know where the advertisements are coming from and so when you're running your computer you will see random ads sometimes this will be random ads showing up on the web browser when you're browsing the web and they have nothing to do with the website that you're visiting the website that you're visiting is not getting money from the ads that the adwords displaying and sometimes these can just display ads whether or not you're on the uh whether or not you're on the web so um you know this is clearly an altogether different level than ad supported applications like the dictionary and weather apps i talked about earlier where it's very clear you're only going to see ads when you're running that particular application and those ads are being used to pay for the free service that you're receiving that's not the case with adware adware is installed typically without your permission sometimes it's installed we'll talk about this a little bit later but it's installed with your permission because there's a big lengthy terms of agreement that you just click through and say yeah yeah yeah okay this all looks fine and it turns out one of the terms is we're going to install something nasty on your computer so um that's uh that's adware um and i do generally i use the term only to represent the malicious version of this software although again some people do refer to adware as uh as anything that displays advertisements or pays for itself using advertisements okay another ad related issue that's come up pretty recently is as you know when your computer visits different websites the computer can run software associated with that website and particularly if they're running client-side javascript it turns out that some websites are now mining for cryptocurrency when you're visiting your their website so this is uh well it's unclear what the morality or legality of this is i suppose it's probably legal it's unclear what the morality of this is um i mean you are visiting their website as long as it only runs when they're visiting your website and stops as soon as you leave i suppose one can make a a reasonable case that this is this is not illegal or immoral but um there have been reports of uh websites that do this sort of thing uh having some sorts of issues where it gets served up by an ad network um or it locks up your computer so anyway potentially problematics is something to be aware of and yet another threat okay zombie computers this is another thing that can be done when malicious software gets installed on your computer basically what happens with the zombie computer is malware is installed on your computer that gives a remote user complete control over your computer the control computers are referred to zombie computers or bots and zombie computers or bots are typically put into groups because these are most useful in a group of computers not a single zombie computer and the group of computers combined together is what we refer to as a bot network i did want to mention that there are several different uses of the term bot and most of the uses are not malicious so if you hear the term but don't immediately think that's necessarily a bad thing so some of the uses of the term bot are independent program that's out crawling the internet so example this would be the google bot which is a program that google uses to request different web pages and it's what it uses to form the index information that google gives you the term bot can also be used to just refer to any uh program that's independently acting on someone's behalf it sort of comes from the term robot anyway i just wanted to mention that so again even though bought in this particular case in in the use particularly with bot networks is a bad thing um if you do hear somebody referring to computers and use the term bot that's not necessarily a negative term by itself so what are bot networks used for well one common use of bot networks is to send spam so we've all got unwanted emails um sometimes they're scam emails and so one question may be like why is this allowed why can't i just block the spam emails and so one of the issues with spam emails is if all the spam emails come from the same computer are the same couple computers then we can just all block them so one thing that these bot networks are used is to send spam emails from many many different computers from all over the world which makes them much harder to block another use is distributed denial service attacks so denial of service attack is when you attempt to deliberately overwhelm a computer by making many many requests on it so i always use the example um suppose stanford students want to bring down the cal computers during big game don't do this by the way this is a violation of stanford's terms of service for your use of stamford computers so and the stanford network so don't do this but suppose we all decided we were going to um on a lark bring down the cal computers during big game week uh what we could do is everybody on stanford campus could just repeatedly hit the cal computers and at some point the cal computer's load would be exceeded and legitimate users trying to access the cal web computers would not be able to access it all right so what happens here well cal kind of looks at uh they're like we seem to be getting a ton of requests our computers are getting overwhelmed what's going on oh look all the requests are coming from stanford university and as you all know now because you've been taking my class uh all the stanford computers have the same or very similar ip numbers so the first couple digits in the ip number are the same and so caltech support says well screw that we're just blocking any request to cal coming from a stanford ip number so that's a standard denial of service attack and obviously they're annoying and a lot of work for tech people to deal with but they can be blocked because they are coming from a specific computer specific range of computers so what a distributed denial service attack does is it says well okay we don't want to have our request denied because they're coming from a specific ip range what we're going to do is we've got this bot network composed of zombie computers all around the world and we will instruct all the bots in our bot network to hit the cal computers and by the way now we're getting into very illegal territory so don't do this and so at that point cal can't really do anything about it because they see many many different ip numbers and there's no specific range of computers that they can go ahead and ban so um all right so that's a distributed denial of service attack and in order to do a distributed denial of service attack you do need something like a bot network with many computers which are geographically dispersed okay another use of bot networks is click fraud so there's two variants of click fraud um so one variant of click fraud you have a website that is displaying advertisements and you want to increase the uh the ad revenue and so what you do is you have uh basically fake advertising clicking where um you know normally you're going to get paid for the advertisements you display on your website particularly on the basis of the number of people that actually click on that ad and look at the website that that advertisement is advertising and so what you can do is you can use a bot network to have different computers from around the world visit your website and click on the ads on your website and that will increase your ad revenue um again also highly illegal alternatively what you can do is you can say hey my competitor has this big ad campaign going on what we're going to do is we are going to deliberately visit websites that are displaying our competitors advertisements and our bots are going to click on those ads no human beings are involved so uh you know nobody's actually going to see those advertisements or click through and look at their actual website or the products that they're selling but it will look like they are and so basically our competitor's ad money is all going to go to paying off the ad network for ads that only our bots are actually clicking on and no real people are actually seeing so that's click fraud um just to provide an example of an actual bot network uh the burrito lab worm slash virus uh we'll talk about worms and viruses momentarily i infected over 30 million computers and it was infecting at a rate of about 3 million computers per month what did this thing do well it stole financial information i remember we talked about spyware copying files earlier it sent out billions of emails including emails which were infected with itself to try and further expand uh the burrito network here it included a key logger to keep track of whatever people typed to get access to their passwords and other information but also it took all those computers that it had affected and created a bot network which could be rented by third parties for 139 000 a month um there is a link to the article thank you maddie that's enough there is a link to the article discussing this network in today's class notes okay uh here's another thing that can be placed in a program this one's a little bit different because um this isn't malicious software that's been installed on your computer this is actually a program that includes something malicious in the program which often was added there by the original programmer so this is called a logic bomb and essentially a logic bomb is something in a piece of software which triggers under specific circumstances so um you've probably seen examples of logic bombs in movies so you know there's a lot of stuff going on in movies that seems to be complete bug but a logic bomb is actually doable so a logic bomb occurs when for example somebody reads a specific file you can trigger some action based on hey this file got red or uh when somebody tries to modify a file and so the idea is this is something added to the program or to the operating system that uh is not part of its intended use that a programmer has placed into this program where if a specific action occurs it's going to go off and do something that something may just be sending an email because sometimes just knowing that somebody is reading a file could be useful information or it could be something much more malicious i saw an example on wikipedia that i rather liked that a programmer who was fired could set up a logic bomb where if they were removed from payroll or somehow payroll mark them as fired it could do something malicious like for example delete files or something like that so you know i think that's a good example of a logic bomb but again you know i think this is one of the few examples where stuff happens in movies and you're like yeah okay that that that's actually related to an actual technique that uh that can be done okay so uh how does this malware get on your computer there's a number of different causes of malware and so we're going to talk about a bunch of these we're talking about viruses worms and trojan horses also i've mentioned zero day exploits before but we'll take a closer look at that and i should mention that there's overlap between these so you know we actually saw this a minute ago with uh burrito lab well there's a virus or worm well actually was both so um there are pieces of software that can cover more than one of these in fact there are pieces of software that can cover all three of these virus worms and trojan horses i suppose all four because it might be based on a day zero zero day exploit okay so what is a virus a virus is a computer program which attaches itself to other programs and so the idea here is um you've got a bunch of programs on your computer and so what the virus is going to do is when it runs it will look for other executable programs on your computer and it will add to the instructions in that program copies of itself so the next time you run that other program the virus code will run there's different ways that the virus figures out which programs to attach itself to sometimes it's designed to attach specific programs sometimes it looks for programs that are running and tries to attach itself to them but the basic idea here is the virus replicates itself by attaching itself to different programs potentially anything that can be executed can be infected and this often includes files that you don't normally think of as executables so zip files for example there's versions of zip files which include executable code which will run when somebody tries to open up the zip file and this is actually why stanford's computers uh stanford's email computers no longer allow you to send zip files you can kind of get that warning and they're like no we don't want people to be send or receive zip files because they are potentially infected microsoft office documents can include scripting information and so because script is essentially a program they can include viruses so viruses can add themselves to microsoft documents um and actually you may notice now uh this this got added relatively recently i think maybe in the last five years where um when you get a copy of a word document or or maybe an excel document from somebody um it will start off and you won't be able to edit it and it'll be like are you sure you want to move into edit mode and so this is again to protect against these sort of situations it's basically running it's allowing you to view the contents of that document in sort of a more protectant mode in case there's something malicious within that document and then it's only when you're like yeah i'm sure i know who sent this to me um this was extracted and i'm pretty sure that they practice safe computing hopefully uh so yeah let's go ahead and open this so i can go ahead and edit it and so that's what's going on there it's trying to protect you from uh viruses attached to the document okay a worm is a program that propagates copies of itself on the network and so we saw an example of this last lecture when i talked about i love you which was a program that was actually a combination of several things it was it was an email that you received that said i love you and then there was an attachment on it and if you open up the attachment it was actually a visual basic script which ran on microsoft outlook which is their email program looking at all of the addresses in your outlook email book and sending copies of itself to everybody in the email book so this is a worm in the sense that it is making copies of itself and propagating itself through a network okay a trojan horse is a program that either does something other than what it claims to do or possibly does exactly what it claims to do but also includes a malicious payload on top of it so just to provide a couple examples we talked previously about how the dalai lama got attacked with the ghost spyware program by opening a document called translation of free movement for tibetans in exile.doc so you know it seems like it was legitimate but it in fact was not actually uh that document or potentially was that document but in addition to the document had a malicious playload attached to the document um certainly i love you uh you know i guess people were like hey somebody loves me they sent me attachment i should open this up and see what it is um yeah they didn't love you sorry and then uh there's also been a bunch of fun quote fun applications like uh weather programs um which you install the weather program and you know i mentioned this earlier if you read through the terms of service it's like oh and i'm going to install this nasty thing on your computer and there was another example where there was basically a cartoon character that would appear on your desktop and people like oh that sounds like fun i should go ahead and install this and it installed that program but did some other malicious stuff in the background so these are examples of trojan horses they are either things which are completely malicious uh like i love you or they are potentially they do one thing but they do some other stuff in the background so like maybe the weather applications actually do show the weather but they also install adware that continues to display advertisements even after you stop using the program or in the case of the buddy program you know they show the bear buddy but in addition to the bear buddy they installed some stuff on your computer so uh those are all trojan horses okay i mentioned zero day exploits before you may recall um last lecture we were talking about stuxnet that was the program which was designed to attack the iranian nuclear centrifuges and we talked about how there were four different zero-day exploits associated with that program so basically a program which uses a zero day exploit is using weakness that is not known by uh security researchers and so the idea here is your computer is not protected against zero day exploits this is something that nobody knows about except for the person that has the zero day exploit and this is the sorts of things that you know nation state security apparatuses like for example the nsa are all about hey can we find an exploit and then the question is are we going to tell microsoft about this exploit are we going to keep it in our back pocket so we can use it to attack other countries so you can't directly defend against a zero day exploit because you don't know what it is uh and the people that made your software don't know what it is but uh you can still practice safe computing and we'll talk about uh things that you can do next lecture that will um hopefully make it harder for somebody with a day zero exploit tool to actually get it on your computer and have it run and take advantage of the weakness in your software on the other hand kind of the opposite of software which is using a zero data exploit is there are many different attacks that occur that are just variants of pre-existing attack so you know software that can be used to attack computers just kind of floating around the internet um and hackers can go ahead and just grab it and you know either just use it directly or make a bunch of tweaks to it and use that and some security experts refer to people that just take these pre-existing programs and use them to attack people as script kitties so this is sort of a derogatory term that those experts use when referring to these hackers that maybe aren't as sophisticated and can't actually come up with their own uh ways of attacking computers so you know there's a lot of stuff already out there um now the thing about the stuff that's already out there is because we do know it's out there uh your operating system manufacturer knows it's out there your web browser manufacturers know it's out there these are not zero-day exploits and so when the when these sorts of things are discovered once upon a time they were zero-day exploits they are now discovered it's a known thing they go ahead and patch their software to prevent these tools from being able to attack your computer and so this is why you really need to keep your software updated you
