welcome to exploring computing today's video is computer security attack vectors and techniques so we're going to talk about a particular attack vector that can be used to compromise your computer security uh specifically social engineering and then after our discussion on social engineering we're going to look at a variety of technical issues involved in various types of attacks on computing systems social engineering is one of the easiest ways to compromise somebody's computer security it's also the one area where you as a non-programmer can make a huge difference in protecting your computer security basically in social engineering the attacker is going to ignore the technical aspects of the security system and instead go for the weakest link which is the humans involved in the process so for example in the old days somebody would call up the tech support for a company and say hey i'm bill gates ceo uh i forgot my password can you go ahead and reset my password and while that may not have happened at microsoft this has definitely happened at other companies at this point of course that whole process is much more automated but nevertheless these sorts of things continue to happen so if somebody's trying to break into a particular account they call tech support pretending to be you they may not be able to get through the first time but they slowly gather more and more information by talking to different tech support staff our customer support staff about that person and over time they're able to get enough information about this person that whose account they're trying to break into in order to fake out the tech support person or customer support person into thinking they really are who they say they are this is particularly problematic for famous people who already have a lot of information out about them um and you may require you may remember that a while back there was a a series of hacks where different actresses had their photographs stolen and it's believed that this is the technique that was used they called tech support pretended to be that particular actress they were convincing enough that the tech support people were willing to help them out and reset the password or something like that and then they were able to break into account that way probably the best known example of a social engineering attack is phishing phishing is where you receive an email or text message purportedly from a company and that attack attempts to get you to enter account information and password or otherwise send along secure data that the attacker should not have access to so one thing to keep in mind based on what you now know from this class is that it is trivially easy to reproduce a web page what do i need to do in order to get a web page to look exactly like the original web page well i copy over the html file i copy the css i may copy the images and some really brazen attacks you don't even bother copying the images you just use the real images on the real website and you just have your own html and css um so you know it's really easy to perfectly exactly replicate a web page so it looks exactly like the original um so what are you going to do to prevent these types of attacks well don't ever click on a link on an email message if you get a message that there's a problem with your account don't click on the link instead go to the main website for that company i say the main website meaning also don't just look at the url provided in the email message and try and type it word you know letter for letter um you know www dash tech support dash you know don't do that just go to the main website type it into the web browser yourself um or uh alternatively call the company directly using a telephone number get the telephone number from somewhere other than the email message like let's say it's claiming to be your credit card flip the back of your actual physical credit card look at the number there call that number do not call the any number provided in the email message it's call the number on the back of your card and say hey i got this email message i don't know if it's a fraud or this is a real deal can you tell me what's going on so you know be very very leery of clicking on anything in an email message remember email is very insecure the sender can be very easily faked the reply to field can be manipulated so the the email message that you're replying to is not going to the original sender it's going to some somebody else um smtp servers these are the servers used to send email messages as opposed to the ones that are used to receive and read our email messages were originally designed for open access um i think they are more and more requiring people to uh use accounts but nevertheless the original architecture was anybody could use any email relay to send their messages so the whole system was just designed completely for insecurity in addition traditionally the email messages themselves have not been encrypted um what has been changing is that many of the major email sites have switched to requiring https and so as long as you are communicating with the server using https any traffic to that website is using https so if you for example were to go to www.gmail.com using https people would not be able to see that traffic specifically but just keep in mind the whole email system again is is very badly designed from a security standpoint a lot of it is just completely insecure and again it's trivially easy to fake the sender on an email message okay so i think one of the scariest types of attacks is a spear phishing attack whereas general phishing emails i mean we probably all get them in fact i know you get them because you're stanford student and stanford gets attacked so we get messages purported to be from stanford security telling us to log into a particular thing reset our password and hopefully they're pretty obvious although you know i'm sure it could be pretty easy to accidentally click on the message and end up being john podesta who you recall clicked on a message he thought was from google and reset his password and therefore all the hillary clinton campaign emails got got released um spearfishing though is much more difficult to prevent what happens in spear phishing attack is the attacker wants to attack a very specific person the attacker is going to study their target they're going to learn about the target's jobs what sorts of things that the target carries out on a regular basis what sort of email messages the target might expect to receive who the target's co-workers are what sort of positions they carry what sort of messages they might be expected to send the target and then what they do is they create a carefully crafted email of the type that the target would typically receive that email may appear to be coming from a co-worker and in fact they can add an extra information into the email message depending on how thoroughly they want to research this you know like hey and it was great singing at the party last friday where we saw sarah and john and so it looks exactly like it's coming from your co-worker and so you go ahead and click on the link or you open the attachment or whatever um and so again i don't know a great way to prevent this sort of attack other than just being super super paranoid um i will say when i receive messages from students that have attachments i'm far more likely to try and open those attachments on my ipad than i am on a pc because the ipad is more of a walled garden where it's difficult for attackers to break out of the email box and do attacks on my computer so you know obviously in a lot of cases i do have to open attachments on messages from students and i don't know who the students are so you know this is an area where you're super vulnerable again i don't know any particularly great ways to prevent it but i do think my opening email messages on the ipad is better than opening them on on my my pc the pc is just easier to attack and it's more likely that anyone not listening to this video would have send send an attack on the assumption that i would be opening on a pc all right it's also possible to mix social engineering with more technical attacks so uh you know i mentioned earlier that last lecture when we talked about how stuxnet was designed to attack the iranian nuclear refinement facilities probably the iranian nuclear refinement facilities had an air gap which is to say that they were not directly attached to the internet um so in order to get on the internal network not attach the internet uh whoever attacked those computers must have had a way to get into that non-attached network and so one way of doing this is with the usb drive so they could have sent in an actual physical agent and stuck a usb drive into one of these computers but it turns out that using social engineering you can actually get people to stick things into their own usb drives without uh you having to actually be there and so the department of homeland security did a test where they went outside of government facilities and they dropped a bunch of usb drives and what was actually on the usb drive was uh a program that would contact the department of homeland security and say hey uh such-and-such usb drive was plugged in um here's the computer was plugged into uh you know and then homeland security would follow up and say hey we dropped this dummy attacker usb drive out of the parking lot somebody plugged it into such and such a computer but that drive could also be not from the department of homeland security not a part of a test exercise but actually contained some sort of a malicious payload what they found was that 60 of the drives they dumped into parking lots were picked up and plugged into computers but if they actually added a logo to the usb drive uh 90 of them were plugged in so like let's say you're out in front of the u.s geological survey office you put a usgs logo on the drive you drop it in the parking lot that greatly increases the chance somebody's going to take it and plug it into one of the computers um to bring in another example at the recent u.s north korean conference um some company handed out a bunch of usb powered fans and people like it's really hot this outside this is really nice i have this fan i want to be able to use this mini fan oh look it's got a usb connector that's providing power all i need to do is plug this into my computer usb port to provide power and then i will have a nice fan and the security experts were like uh this is a really bad idea they did study them as far as they were able to discern none of them had payloads but um you know you could easily imagine somebody being like oh this is a cute gimmick oh i understand i need to plug into my computer provide power that's pretty normal great let's go ahead and do this and in fact it includes some sort of a payload that attacks your computer so don't plug anything into any of your computer ports um unless it's coming from a trustworthy source okay so um again i i really do want to emphasize social engineering because this is the one attack area that you all can make the biggest difference and so you know pay attention again with the phishing attacks never never never click on a link in an email message assume that it's leaving you somewhere nefarious even if it looks legit so there's various techniques that people can do to make addresses look legitimate even though they're not so you know maybe the normal dot is replaced by dash so you know just be super super careful don't click on those links instead again just open up a web browser and you know the name of the company you know what their regular web address is go to that regular web address and log in that way or again call them up by phone okay now we're going to take a look at more technical ways attacks can occur the first one i wanted to talk about is something called sql injection and so uh i really like this cartoon from xkcd thank you to xkcd for allowing use of their cartoons by nonprofits uh there's a link to the cartoon down below um i think this really illustrates sql injection really well so here's uh here's a little cartoon uh you can see somebody's calling um this mother and they say hi this is your son's school we're having some computer trouble and she says oh dear did he break something and they say in a way did you really name your student did you really name your son robert quote parentheses semicolon drop table students semicolon oh yes little bobby tables we call them well we've lost this year's student records i hope you're happy and i hope you learn to sanitize your database inputs so what's going on here this is an injection attack in an injection attack the attacker enters code in a place where the system only expects text so the idea here is here's the name of the student um robert quotepren and so that quote after the name robert terminates the string from the standpoint of whoever is taking this string from this text field and sticking it into part of a sql command and so they're basically just taking uh text inserting it into a pre sql command is slapping this text string onto the end of some text that they've already provided and so the effect here is that end quote after robert terminates the string and then the rest of this stuff gets directly inserted in as an actual command which will actually be executed by the computer in this case using the sql database and the result is it destroys the students table so the solution to this is you need to do what's called sanitize your inputs and so the idea here is you need to set up your code in such a way that anything the user provides is strictly treated as text and cannot be accidentally interpreted as a command so really a sql injection attack or any injection attack um is the result of the programmer being sloppy and writing code that's quick and easy for them to write without going through the extra step of saying i'm going to take this input that the user's entered and i'm not just going to attach it to the end of some pre-existing command i'm actually going to convert the entire thing explicitly to something that cannot be treated as a command and that's what i'm going to use as a string we've talked earlier in the quarter about how when you have the name of an html file i recommend you just use letters numbers and the dash and that if you use additional characters like say the space character they actually get encoded in the special url encoding so a space for example you've probably seen this occasionally on actual websites a space actually gets converted to a percent 20 which ends up being the ascii code for for space and so that's an example of encoding so what's going on there is the coding process is saying i don't want to treat this as a space which has actual syntactic meaning in places where i might use the string so i'm going to convert it to the sequence of characters percent to zero which cannot be misinterpreted as part of the syntax character for whatever purpose i might be using this particular string for so you need to do the same thing or the programmer needs to do the same thing on their side they need to take that whatever the user's entered and use some sort of encoding that is going to remove any of the characters that might be misinterpreted in the particular language in our little example here in the sql language as potential commands okay cross-site scripting um contrary to this the name of this particular text technique this is another type of injection attack in this case though we're actually going to inject script into somebody else's web page and so an example of this is suppose we've got a website that displays user names or maybe user comments like maybe it's a bulletin board or it's a newspaper that's running its own comment section and what they do is they allow people to enter say for example their name they allow them to enter a comment uh they take that information stuff into the database and then when somebody else comes to visit that website they take that name and comment and just stick it back out on the web page so what you're going to do in this particular type of attack is instead of entering a username or maybe instead of entering that comment you're actually going to stick in javascript code including a script tag and if the server is not sanitizing its inputs it's just taking the information that the user has entered into the text field or the text area it's going to stick that script tag back out and it will send your javascript that you've injected onto anybody's web page that visits uh that website so that's a credits chris site scripting attack and the protection against cross-site scripting is to you know sanitize your inputs make sure that regardless of what the user enters it is not treated as actual html that it is instead treated just as text so you know maybe you can get rid of that less than sign or you can look specifically for tags as you say tags are not allowed get rid of any less than signs greater than signs or something like that okay click jacking click jacking attacks causes the user to unintentionally click on something this can be used for a bunch of different purposes so for example could be used to increase ad counts or it could be used to cause the user to inadvertently purchase something through amazon's one-click purchase link okay let's walk you through how click jack attack works this requires knowledge of a bunch of different html tags and css properties so the first one is an iframe an iframe tag allows the user or the creator of a web page to place a different html page within the main html page so in this particular case i'm using the iframe tag and you know i'm sure we've got cat fans out there who are unhappy with all my dog examples so what we're going to do here is we're going to put a cat example in the middle of my dog example here and so you can see that cat section down in the bottom right hand corner that is actually a different html file and it's been inserted by using this iframe so as you can see the iframe refers to source cats.html and so we're actually going to load up the cats.html file so the cat file has its own section which is being displayed in the web browser within my dogs file here step two um i need to know about something called cascading style teach positioning cascading style sheets positioning allows me to move elements around the web page and place them wherever i want so in this particular case i have moved the cat's iframe from the lower right and i'm actually placing it in the top left hand corner and when you place something absolutely it actually overlays anything that's underneath it so the cat's iframe is now on top of the information about dogs and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to change the opacity of that iframe i've reduced the opacity to 25 so we can actually see it but in a real click jacking attack which you could make it just completely invisible so what we've got is we've got a part of our web page which actually is a different website or a different web page in this particular case it's a different web page cats.html and dogs.html are on this on the same website but this could just as easily be a different website say for example amazon and it would be completely invisible so that's there on the web page but the user can't actually see it and then the last thing we do is we have something on our web page that we think the user will click on uh so you know maybe there's a link there or there's a button which claims it does something and so the user clicks on a particular location on our web page but what they're actually clicking on is they're clicking on the invisible iframe which is actually a different website say for example an invisible copy of amazon positions exactly so that the one-click purchase button is in the exact location where we're making the user think if they click on that location something different will happen so they they go to our website they click on you know what they think is one thing but they're actually clicking on an invisible iframe showing something we're trying to get them to purchase with the one click button directly on the location where they're clicking okay so how do we prevent a click jacking attack so this is really up to the websites who don't want the cervitech to happen to them or their customers and so what you can do if you're amazon is you can make sure that your web page will not be displayed within an iframe there's several different techniques to do this um you can include information the http header uh you'll recall that that includes things like um hey this is how long this web page is good for this is when it expires or this is a particular encoding we've got you can also send information in those headings that say web browser don't place me inside of an iframe um you can also use javascript to force your web page to the top of the frame hierarchy so there's a bunch of different ways to prevent click jacking but it does depend upon the creator of a website realizing that click jacking is a thing and making sure that their website can't be used in conjunction with a click jacking attack one thing that some programs depend upon particularly in particular web browsers depend upon is something called sandbox security and so the idea behind sandbox security is client-side programmers running in a web browser can do a certain number of things to interact with the computer so for example they can control what's being displayed in the web browser window and so things that the website can do those are considered within the sandbox um and things that that website can't do are considered outside of the sandbox so for example accessing files on the user's computer that it's outside the sandbox so a web browser will not allow a website to directly access the file system accessing the camera and microphone are generally outside of the sandbox although i think increasingly you may see that that that's sort of included in the sandbox but needs special permissions but the basic idea here is uh the program in this case the web browser is saying hey in order to allow people to create cool and interesting websites we want them to have access to a whole bunch of different capabilities that stuff is going to be in the sandbox but then we need a clear delineating line on what is outside the sandbox and what they can't access so you know in the case you're wondering uh probably to freak this out but this comes from the idea of you can put your kid in the sandbox and the kid can play around with their toys uh and as long as they stay in that sandbox they're in a safe environment but we don't want them to uh you know get out of the sandbox and you know maybe the pool's nearby we don't want to go to the pool we don't want them to actually get in with the dogs at the dog park so that's the idea behind sandbox security now the one thing to be aware of is there are a variety of different ways to get outside of sandbox and in particular plugins or extensions often have access outside of the sandbox so you should be really cautious installing plugins or extensions i think the web browsers have gotten a bit better on specifically telling you what that web browser plug-in wants access to but just be aware if you stick in a plug-in that plug-in may have access to absolutely everything so if you go to website and the website is like hey you need to download this plug-in in order to use this view this web page properly you know unless you're sure you trust that website and you trust whoever made that plugin say no it's not worth it to randomly see something in three dimensions and risk compromising your whole web browser security including all your banking information so you know say no unless there's a good reason to say yes and unless you really trust this person okay uh on a somewhat related note there's something called drive by download and drive by download tries to get you to install malicious software so our example of the web browser plugin that could be an example of drive by download how do we get the user to install software well one thing we might do is we might depend upon the gullibility of the user so they visit our website and you know we claim there's a plugin that they need to download or uh you know we start up a download message to be like hey we think you have a virus click here and we'll clean it up for you alternatively web browsers will sometimes have security vulnerabilities that allow the website to download something on the computer directly so a computer or a web browser vulnerability could be identified where if you visit the website it forces the download or the installation of something okay man in the middle attacks uh in the man-in-the-middle attack what we do is we insert a malicious computer between the victim's computer and the computer they are trying to communicate with and the idea behind a man-in-the-middle attack is we want to make it invisible to the victim that they actually are being attacked so suppose i'm trying to communicate with my bank and there's a malicious computer between me and my bank and when i enter my name and password i think i'm communicating with my bank but what's actually happening is i'm passing my name and password to the malicious computer and the malicious computer is taking that information and passing it onward to my bank the bank sends the information back to the malicious computer thinking it's me and the malicious computer passes the information on to me and as far as i'm concerned it looks like i'm actually properly communicating with my bank but in fact there's a hacker in between us this can among other things get be used to get around uh two-factor authentication where um i try and log into my bank but my account is set up with two-factor authentication which is a really good thing we'll talk more about it next lecture where the bank sends me maybe a text message with a number and it says okay patrick um i see you're trying to log in uh you seem to be logging in from this random location i don't know about so i texted you a message with an identification number and so what can happen is i enter my name and password into the man in the middle the compute malicious computer in the middle it passes on my login information to the my bank computer the bank computer sees this come from a new location says okay i text you a message and says enter in the id number or unique code that i just sent you the man in the middle passes that request on to me i look on my phone i see the number i enter it i pass it on to the hacker in the middle and the hacker passes it on the bank the hacker is now into my bank account okay um if security is working properly and you are using security man-on-the-middle attacks should not work so there are a couple things that the person running the man on the middle attack needs to have in order to get these things to work first thing is the man in the middle requires the computer to be in the middle so you know it's it's not like it's necessarily that easy getting between me and my bank but there are ways it can be done uh particularly like if it's the nsa or the fbi and they really want to attack me well you know they can get uh some sort of a court order and actually stick something on the line between say me and the rest of the internet so yeah that that's doable uh but in general something needs to happen that is going to allow the attacker to insert their computer between uh me and the computer that they want to simulate they also need a way to overcome the identity protections and encryptions used by the the website and by my web browser assuming i'm actually using them if i'm not if i'm communicating with something using http which is the non-secure version of the web protocol instead of https which is a secure version then all bets are off then it's just super easy then they just have to get between me and the website okay how can how can they get around these problems well um you know you may have heard people say don't connect to random uh wi-fi points or be cautious at web cafes and and other situations where you know you sit down at starbucks oh here's a wi-fi router that looks like it's starbucks sure let me just go ahead and connect in there because this is one place where you can insert a man in a metal attack so you know i think i'm communicating with starbucks wi-fi but in fact i am communicating with hackers wi-fi the hacker is now between me and the rest of the internet and they can run their man in the middle scheme how do you get around this certification encryption issue one thing is you can assume the user will just accept the certificates so if you log into the stanford unix machines um they will send you this big long identification string saying hey here's my security identification you can double check and make sure that this really is the stanford computer it says it is and the thing about the stanford unix computers is there are dozens of them so there are dozens and dozens of these uh identification strings and unless and so basically every time you log into one of these computers you might actually be logging into a different one so you know the first time i might be logging into rice.stanford.iu it might actually be rice12 next time it might be rice5 next time it might be rights 3 then it might be rice and so these all have different very long unique identification strings and so if i start getting lazy i don't bother looking up those identification strengths and saying oh yeah that really is rice 12. i just accept it this would allow somebody who's a man in the middle to pretend to be one of these computers and me not realize that it's actually a hacker's computer another possibility is to get a real fake certificate and so just as an example the dutch certification authority denoter was hacked and its private keys were compromised and so whoever hacked them and got a hold of their private keys was able to generate new certificates claiming to be from diginotar which was considered a reasonable certification authority at the time the web browsers have since been fixed to not allow diginotar certificates to be used and the company's gone belly up um we also talked about i think i talked about earlier that when we talked about certification authorities that somebody got one of the certification authorities to issue them a certificate claiming microsoft when in fact they weren't microsoft it's also possible to get the user to install a new certification authority so you visit the website and you get a message saying hey this website is using a certificate i don't recognize the certification authority do you want to add hackers r us as the uh as a trusted certification authority and hope that the user is dumb enough to say yes this is why again be extremely cautious adding new certification authorities to your web browser in general there isn't a great reason at this point for somebody to use a non-standard certification authority uh certificates have gone cheap enough um from reasonable certification authorities that this should not be an issue anymore but uh you know the user visits the website uh they think it's their bank it's not their bank because they've been redirected by the man in the middle they get a message saying hey your bank says uh it's got the certificate but you need to prove this particular certification authority uh not you could easily see an iv user being like okay i don't know what the heck that is i guess this is fine i'm gonna go ahead and click on the yes and so they think they're now communicating with their bank we've also had this was really scary but we also had a weakness in one of the wi-fi protocols of wpa2 that actually allowed a particular type of attack to grab the encryption key this was discovered we hope first by a white hat hacker and so uh these are the good guys and so they basically said hey if i do this and that i can actually get around the security on wpa2 and so they notified everybody wpa2 is not secure um we don't know of anybody who discovered this before uh everybody was notified but it's certainly possible somebody else discovered this ahead of time and was using this in order to perform man in the middle of tags okay another issue that will come up particularly if you're developing a website or you're writing software is if you are using somebody else's software on your website or you're using open source code as part of a project you're working on you inherit the vulnerabilities of that software so just as an example um i know a bunch of people who are working on this game project and i visited their website and i repeatedly was taken to a third website which was clearly not associated with the original website you guys have probably all seen this before where you go visit a website and um you know you instantly get taken to random download this game or you know some other thing that clearly has nothing to do with the original website what's going on there well so i notified them and they told me that they they didn't realize this was happening because they never visited their website using a ios web browser they always visited just on their pcs but they did some research and it turned out that they were using a plug-in on their website a wordpress plugin and that that wordpress plugin had been compromised there was a new version of that plug-in that avoided the problem but um but yeah basically because they used this wordpress plugin that had been written by somebody else and that wordpress plugin had been hacked uh their website was basically now hacked um so while the people who wrote that plug-in had not intended to uh you know cause problems they hadn't intended it to be a just a regular nice plug-in that people could put in their wordpress websites in some cases the owner of that plug-in or other open source project that you're depending upon may actually end up maliciously changing their code so there's a couple circumstances where this could occur one is if you're using open source code open source code means that anybody can go ahead and go in and modify the code so the best prevention for this is to make sure that you are working with open source code that is widely used the more widely it is used the more likely there are lots of people looking at this code and making sure that if anybody inserts something into the code it's going to be noticed and will be shut down if you're using some open source project that's only being used by you know like a dozen people are those dozen people security experts are they paying attention what's going on with that code um and so it's relatively easy to insert malicious code into those sorts of projects so be super careful using open source code that is not widely used and widely studied in addition um there have been incidences where somebody creates some sort of a free project it starts gaining traction uh and they decide hey maybe i'm tired of supporting this thing because honestly it's a pain constantly supporting code that's that's changing uh and so that they want out and somebody else offers them a whole bunch of money and says hey we want to take over your code uh here's a lot of cash and they're like great i went out um here you now control the code i'll let my users know you're controlling the code now and then what happens is that company now that now controls the code you know maybe they insert something into the code uh because it's no longer a free project maybe they added some spying software tracking software uh or you know maybe something more malicious uh so you know this is potentially a problem so yeah there's a lot of free software out there that's great uh and you know i don't want to get people too paranoid but uh do pay attention if the free software that you are using changes hands or is sold to another company uh you need to know who now owns the software and if you trust them okay um here's another uh attack technique i ran into this one's a little bit scary this is vulnerabilities in the original ip protocol and so you may recall that the ip packets bounce around the internet and they can get rerouted in different directions depending on what the internet traffic looks like and so what happens in this type of attack is that the attacker starts sending information out about how the internet traffic is doing and forces internet packets through their particular computer so as an example in 2010 15 of all internet traffic went through china for 18 minutes due to a quote misconfiguration of china telecom servers so traffic reddit through china included internet traffic from the us senate the army the navy the air force the office of the secretary of defense and nasa so basically what happened here was china claims this was accidental but what happened was china's telecom company um basically told the rest of the internet hey you should route your traffic through us uh we are the fastest way to get to your destination so uh you know if you're sending information from the pentagon to the white house it'll be faster if you route it through china and the internet blithely went along with that and sent all the ip packets through china uh in a different incident 20 in 2013 internet traffic from mexico to the us was rated routed through belarus um for similar reasons and you know there's really no reason why traffic will go through belarus if it was starting in mexico in antenna for the u.s um so what could this be used for well for one thing if there's anything unencrypted any unencrypted packets going through uh those can just be read and this also you know we talked a minute ago about how in the man on the middle attack you need to get between the person and the computer uh they're communicating with well using a technique like this you are now in the middle between that person and the community computer they're communicating with all right so um [Music] this gives you an idea of the variety of different ways computers can get attacked of course there are many other ways computers can get attacked but uh you know i hope this gives you a sense of the broad range of things that can happen to
