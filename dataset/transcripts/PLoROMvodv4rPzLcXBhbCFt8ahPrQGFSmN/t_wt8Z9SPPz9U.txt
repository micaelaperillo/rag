welcome to exploring computing today's video is computer networks part two naming so in the last video we saw how we can connect different computers together and we can combine networks into internetworks and so we're done right our computers are hooked together we can connect networks from one side of the country to the next we're all set well not exactly let's just take an example from our small classroom network so as we saw in the last video the wi-fi network in a classroom could be considered a star network where the wireless router is the central hub and each student's laptop is one of the outside nodes now when i was in college i actually got busted passing notes in a class the sad thing is i wasn't even in the class i went to the class because a girl who i thought was really cute invited me to sit in with her in her class and we got busted passing notes but the good news is 30 years later we're still best friends but that won't happen to you guys because you guys can just text each other i won't even know you're doing it so let's say you're in the classroom and you want to type a message and here's our message here notice the use of the unicode heart emoji you now know how that works internally from the first lecture so let's say we want to send this message to a friend who's across the classroom so go ahead and type in the message and then wait a minute so our computers are all hooked together but we have no way of identifying each of the individual computers so in order for me to send this message to a specific computer as opposed to everybody in the classroom although this is a fine message for everybody in the classroom i would need a way of identifying individual computers on the network so this is the main topic of today's video how are we going to name or identify computers on the network and it turns out there are a couple different naming schemes the first naming scheme is something called a physical address or a mac address mac in this case does not stand for macintosh it actually stands for media access control but i wrote that in really small font because you don't really need to know that most people don't um so this is an example of a physical address or a mac address again those two names are synonymous and you can see it consists of an a sequence of what kind of look like numbers but they've kind of got letters mixed in so these are hexadecimal numbers so they're base 16 instead of base 10 or base 2 and they're very easy to convert from hexadecimal to binary which is why computer scientists like to use them okay so zero zero zero one forty two af three b o five and that's our mac address for our computer and these are sometimes written with dashes between them and occasionally you'll see them written with columns between them this is actually one of the numbers that you provide to stanford when you register a device with a stanford network it's actually how stanford realizes that your computer is okay to let on the network okay there's a couple things about physical or mac addresses first of all of course every computer needs a unique mac address so these are all unique numbers the second thing is that first set of six hexadecimal digits those are actually a manufacturing prefix and so here are some of apple's prefixes they actually have quite a few they have over two dozen but here's some examples so if you've got a mac address that starts zero zero zero a nine five zero zero one six cb zero zero two one e9 we know that you have a macintosh computer and here are some of samsung's addresses so you get the basic idea every manufacturer has a whole bunch of prefixes and whenever they create a computer or tablet or smartphone they use a mac address that starts with their prefix and i should also mention that most computers actually have multiple mac addresses so you might have one mac address for your wi-fi you might have a different mac address for bluetooth and if your computer actually hooks to ethernet you would have a third mac address for that i can use this to get my message from my computer to my friend's computer across the classroom and this works great so are we done well not yet so it turns out there's a problem with this so here we've got a bunch of computers being manufactured by apple and they're coming off the assembly line you can see they all share the same set of numbers except for that last digit is changing and so basically you come up with another device you change the last digit of the number you come from the device you come you change the last digital last number so that's great that does come with a whole bunch of unique numbers for all the apple computers which is what you need but here's the thing these computers are going to go to different locations one of them might go to stanford when i might go to the university of texas one might go to harvard one of them might get lucky and go off to europe so if we use these mac addresses to send messages across the internet that would be like the postal service using social security numbers to send letters social security numbers are unique so if we use them to address letters there's no ambiguity we know exactly who that letter is supposed to go to and so here i've got three letters it turns out their love letters not because i'm romantic but because i thought it would be easier to use an emoji than to draw a letter it turns out i guess the only emoji for letters is the love letter emoji and so if we handed these three letters to the post office gave them the social security number of the three people we wanted to send them to the post office will look at us and say what are you crazy so clearly the system doesn't work and in the same way delivering messages across the internet using mac addresses doesn't work because the mac address has nothing to do with where that computer is located it's a unique number based on where that computer was manufactured not where it is right now so it doesn't work very well it will work for a small local area network so it can work in the classroom effect um a lot of the the small networks actually do use the mac addresses directly for this purpose but we need another system to get messages across the wider network as opposed to within a single network so i do want to make it clear that the mac addresses are used they're just used within the local network so they're an important component but they are not sufficient by themselves if we want to get a message outside of our local network okay so here's our next naming scheme these are called ip addresses or ip numbers the ip stands for internet protocol and that actually is going to turn out to be important so i wrote that with a slightly larger font but we'll be talking about internet protocol in quite some detail next lecture okay so the traditional ip addresses ip numbers look like this there's four digits separated by dots and each of the digits goes between 0 and 255 and if you think about it why do we go from 0 to 55 because that's the range of values we can store on a byte so really what these ip addresses are they're four bytes now there's a little problem with this traditional ip address which is if i've got four bytes i can store 2-32 different combinations which gives me a little over 4 billion combinations and there are 7.8 billion people on the planet so we don't have enough ip addresses for everyone and what's more many of you including me have multiple ip addresses because everything that we've got connected to the internet needs one so if you've got a cell phone and a laptop well that's two you've got a smart tv that's three you got a tablet that's four you've got a gaming console that's five and then one more thing is these numbers were not handed out equitably so it turns out that stanford university was one of the first four sites on the original internet when the internet was first developed and we had a huge range of numbers and so we actually gave a bunch of numbers away a while back because we didn't need our full range of numbers but ultimately this is clearly a problem and this scheme can't stand so there's a newer version of ip and it uses addresses that look like this and these look kind of scary to me so if they look scary to you they look scary to me these consist of eight sets of 16 bits each each single hexadecimal digit corresponds to four bits so two sets of hexadecimal digits corresponds to a byte and since these are each four sets of hexadecimal digits they're each 16 bits and there are eight of them so it turns out there's a total of 128 bits here and if we do the math again with our traditional system we have 32 bits spread across 4 bytes we have 232 combinations so we have a little over 4.2 billion combinations with a new scheme we have 228 which if you work it out as 3.4 times 10 to the 38. how big is that well 10 to the 38 is a 1 followed by 38 0. so this is a really really really big number and so we should be fine even if you guys end up with way more than the three or four ip addresses that you need now in the future so the original scheme is called ipv4 and it's still quite widely used but the sooner or later we do need to move everything over to this new version the new version is called ipv6 now here's the thing our previous scheme the mac address also known as physical addresses gave each computer a unique number and the ip addresses are going to do the same thing but whereas the mac or physical addresses were assigned by the computer manufacturer the ip addresses are going to be assigned by your internet service provider so this isn't going to be like the post office where we're trying to send things using social security numbers instead what we're going to do is we're going to take our ip address and i'm using the traditional ipv4 both because i'm way more comfortable reading them and it's much easier not using those super super super long numbers for our examples okay so here's here's a letter we're trying to send on the internet we've got this ip number 181.12.83.0 i look at the first two digits there 181.12 and i immediately know that that is a stanford university ip address remember i told you we have a whole bunch of ip addresses more than we need it so this is a part of the range that we kept and so i know it's in the united states i know it's stanford university but i actually know more than that if i look at the 1812 and then i look at the 83 i actually know it's gavel on dorm i'm using galvan for example because that's where i was as a resident fellow for 12 years okay so i can get to that particular dorm and so you can see that we can route it not only to the internet service provider but the internet service provider can set up their system so that they can route it even further within the system down to the point where the routing software can just keep track of of this particular person here's their mac address i actually know where that mac address is located and so this system will work to route anything within the internet now keep in mind since these numbers are related to your internet service provider if you have a particular number here when you're at stanford and let's say you fly home and you're now on comcast you're going to get a different ip address we're not done yet the problem is these ip addresses are not very easy to remember there are some people that know a bunch of ipv4 addresses mostly computer tech people there are certain ipv4 addresses on campus that they need to know but i'm rather doubtful anybody has any of these ipv6 addresses memorized so this is not not sufficient so we need another scheme and that is host names and this is what you guys are used to so like www.stanford.edu www.nasa.gov all those addresses that you are used to those are called host names and there's a system to convert from a host name to an ip address ultimately all traffic on the internet travels using the ip addresses we've got one other major naming system to talk about and while the previous naming systems were used to identify computers on the internet this particular naming system is used to identify programs running on a single computer so here's my computer here and i'm running a number of different programs i'm running a web browser i'm running an email program i'm running a messaging system and i'm streaming music and so my computer is receiving information from lots of different computers out on the internet and so when my computer receives that information it needs to figure out which one of the various programs that i'm running that information should be sent to and that's what this port number system is used for so here's some common port numbers uh web browsing uses port 80. email uses port 143 actually email has several different ports associated with it facebook messaging uses port 522 and so on so if my computer receives data and it's marked with port 143 my computer knows that that should be forwarded on to the email program whereas if my computer receives information marked with port 3689 it knows that that goes to the music program and if it gets information with port 80 it knows that it should go to the web browser you may run into these port numbers particularly in relationship to computer security the firewall would turn these ports on or off and we'll talk about that when we get to the security lecture but essentially what's happening here is with the firewall is it's controlling what information goes out of the computer and what information comes onto the computer based on the port number so it says oh you don't use this particular port maybe this is the standard port that's used for for a particular program but you're not using that program so if i start receiving traffic to your computer trying to get through that port it's probably somebody trying to hack the program associated with that port or somehow use some sort of vulnerability in the software to to get into your computer so i'm going to go ahead and block that port and you're only going to turn on the ports that you actually need for the programs that you're running you may also hear the term socket this is related essentially a socket is a connection between two computers um so you can see here i've got a web server this web server has sockets open to three different computers i've got a line drawn showing a single one of these sockets where the web server is communicating with 124.12.0.152 that's my ip address and it's on port 80 and then i would have different sockets open to these other computers that my web server is sending information to all right that's it for today but we will continue taking a look at the internet in the next lecture i'll see you then you
