welcome to exploring computing today's video is the internet of things so as i suggested at the end of the last video when we were talking about mesh edge and fog computing more and more devices that are not thought of as traditional computing devices are being put onto the internet and this network of non-traditional computing devices is sometimes referred to as the internet of things and so let's take a quick look at some examples of devices that fit onto the internet of things so you have a better sense of exactly what i'm talking about i think as a consumer probably the most likely place that you are to run into these sorts of devices are in the concept of a smart home so if you've got a smart light bulb for example that would be considered internet of things why would you want a smart light bulb well if you have smart light bulbs you can control their colors so you know if you've ever shopped for light bulbs there's the do you want the bright white do you want the soft white do you want the warm white well if you've got a smart light bulb you can just kind of change the rating on the fly you'd be like oh i have some friends coming over i want to make it a little bit warmer or you know i'm trying to do some artwork on the table and i wanted to to have pure white light so i know exactly what it is i'm drawing great i'll go ahead and crank that up and you can also control the light bulbs for uh you know if you're remote uh and you're not there and you want it to make it look like you're there you can you know control those remotely and so there's there's a bunch of potential reasons why you might want to have smart light bulbs as to whether or not it's worth it to have smart light bulbs and what security risks are well that's kind of up to you we'll talk about security risks a little bit later in this lecture um you can have sensors connected to the internet these can be combined with smart speakers for example so if you've got a house with smart speakers and sensors as you move from one room to the next it can turn the speakers on and off and the music that you're playing could follow you around from one room to another thermostats can be connected to the internet where you can process the data and control it again remotely and you know do some analytics on it so there's a variety of different devices that are being connected to the internet and i suspect this will this trend will continue and more and more devices will just seem natural your kids will probably think it's totally normal whereas i'm still a little weirded out we have smart light bulbs all right uh here's another example internet of things this is probably one of the best uses i've seen so when i was in the stanford dorms as a resident fellow they actually put the washers and dryers onto the internet and so this was actually really handy because it meant that usually the washer dryers are all in the basement they were in the first floor for our building but you know if you're in uh your room and you want to know whether or not you can do your laundry you just check the internet page and it's like hey dryers one and four are available so great you go grab your laundry you drag it downstairs you know that there's an available washer there and it's also pretty handy in terms of seeing when you're when your load is going to be done so you can check in and say it'll say oh you know you put your clothes in washer number four and washington number four has 15 minutes left so um i thought this was pretty handy and you can imagine in a big building or a building where there's a lot of uh use of the washer and dryers and it's kind of hard getting getting access to them having this sort of information it actually is quite handy um transportation is another area where we're getting more and more internet of things types of capabilities so just in a car you know clearly the navigation system or the entertainment system you know that could be part of the internet and in fact many of us just use our cell phones for that so that is part of the internet um there's some discussion on whether the engines and uh actuators for things like controlling um how the engine works uh whether or not those should be part of the internet of things i think there are some potential concerns with uh security in terms of if everything in the car is part of the internet i think it makes a little bit easier to hack um you can have the cars communicating with each other so each of the individual cars could be part of the internet um and this actually could be really useful in terms of you know we can get different data sort of like waze does right now where all the cars are talking to each other and so they can tell each other what the traffic conditions are so one of them could say hey i was just going across the bay bridge 15 minutes ago you don't want to go that way it's just a complete nightmare go go a different direction you can embed sensors into the roadways and turn the roadways into smart systems and then using the internet they could talk to the cars here's another really cool use of the internet you can have smart parking meters where if you're looking for space all the parking meters are part of a network and they all have little sensors telling whether or not they're available and you can just be like hey i need a parking space where is the nearest parking space that is currently available and it'll connect in with your smartphone and you just look on your little map and you go to that parking space so i think that's really cool you can also connect it into paying remotely being reminded hey you've only got five more minutes on the meter do you want to uh up up put out a little bit more money there and get another a half hour or another hour so i think i think some of these can be potentially quite useful so another area where uh the internet can be used is in industrial processes and uh this actually forms a separate area that's sometimes referred to as the industrial internet of things so we can take a standard industrial process and start instrumenting it by adding different things in that process onto the internet we can add sensors that are on the internet we can have controllers that can actually be actuated via the network we can control inventory management using rfid tags i'll talk about those in a little bit more detail in a minute um if we've got a fleet of vehicles we can connect them all to the internet and keep track of those and i will have to say personally i'm fond of delivery vehicles which are on the internet and we can see where they're coming mostly because um delivery often has big trouble finding my apartment and so knowing when they're in the area is actually pretty useful for me um and we can control we can add security like motion sensors cameras and lights onto the internet as well so these are all um areas that you know they're certainly moving into this area and i think again we'll see more and more of this all right let's go back to this idea of rfids these are radio frequency ids generally the devices with the rfids themselves are not part of the internet but the device is reading the ids will be part of the internet of things so an rfid is similar to a bar code so um you know if you've been to the grocery store and i'm sure you've all been to the grocery store at one point or another those little barcodes that they used to run at the checks checkout stand to see what the uh the particular item that you're purchasing is and what the price of them is that's the barcode and so an rfid is very similar to a barcode in that it provides a unique number or a number that's associated with a particular product but the difference between an rfid and a barcode is that we need to optically scan the barcode or so for the rfid i don't need to optically scan it i just need that rfid tag to be within a certain distance of my rfid reader and the actual distance for the rfid reader does vary depending on there's a bunch of different competing standards but on the low end you can read the rfid tech from about a meter away at the high end you could actually read them as far as 200 meters away and in a lot of cases the rfids don't actually have their own power they're going to be triggered remotely by the device that's that's scanning the area for them so uh one of the most compelling scenarios i've heard for using rfids is inventory management so currently if you've ever been in a store or you've been part of the staff of a store that's doing inventory you've got all the employees out and they're running around down each the aisles pulling all the items off the shelf and counting them all up and it's extremely time consuming measure um and it you know it's it's annoying and time consuming well with an rfid on each of the items you don't need to do that anymore all you need to do is you need to take an employee with an rfid reader and just walk down each of the aisles of the stores and the rfid reader will sort of ask each of the boxes on the shelves hey what's your id number and i'll count them all up and you'll be done so inventory counting will go from a huge undertaking to a very simple quick undertaking the main reason why we aren't doing this right now is the rfid prices are still a little bit too high um the low end is around 10 cents per rfid so you know if we were to do this at the grocery store or at the drugstore um it would add 10 cents to the cost of all the items and so uh that's still fairly high but the first time i gave this lecture it was actually 15 cents per rfid so it does seem to be coming down in value and you can imagine once it's down to a couple pennies per item it's probably going to be worth it to switch over okay so there are some concerns that to note about the internet of things one of them is you know how are these devices connecting to the internet so most of the devices we use that connect to the internet either use wi-fi or bluetooth wi-fi takes a fair amount of energy so that's kind of problematic unless this device is actually plugged in there is a bluetooth low energy standard and so this is the choice for a lot of internet of things devices this also potentially adds a lot more devices to the internet so if you start counting up how many devices you already have i'm sure you have a laptop you've got a cell phone you might have a tablet i do you might have a bunch of game consoles your television might connect to the internet so that's a fair number of devices but once we start adding a whole bunch of other devices like your oven's connecting to the internet your refrigerator is connecting the internet your heaters are connecting the internet it starts adding up pretty quickly and we are already running out of ipv4 numbers so this would really accelerate the move to ipv6 you'll recall from our discussion on the internet that um ipv4 uses a set of four numbers between zero and 255 and that there aren't enough numbers using that standard so ipv6 is a standard with many many more combinations you hear maddie barking in the background it's because there's a dog outside that's barking and she's she's all excited about that okay the other concern about internet of things and i guess this goes along with maddie barking there uh is that i think there's a lot of security concerns with internet of things and there's a bunch of reasons why you should be particularly careful with the internet of things one issue is that a lot of times the internet of things they're trying to keep the device cost down so you know anytime you're keeping the cost down that means you're potentially shortchanging a security and so that is a bit of a concern i think another reason why i have concerns about the internet of things is a lot of times uh the cool internet of things stuff that comes out it's some somebody has this idea for hey wouldn't it be great if this device was on the internet and so they go ahead and and set it up but they don't actually have any security people they aren't familiar with security issues on their own and maybe they don't have the money to hire somebody who's a specialist in security so you know i would say be cautious like if you see some random kickstarter and you're like that seems like a really cool idea but it connects the internet like do you trust them to have good security you also need to remember to update your internet of things devices and this isn't something that a lot of consumers are thinking about i mean who thinks about keeping their light bulbs updated all the time so let's take a look at a couple examples where internet of things devices have failed so smart light bulbs have been hacked and you might be thinking well if somebody takes over my light bulb what's the worst that can happen but these are considered potential ways to get around your security you can can hack somebody's light bulb remotely you are now in their internal home internet and so that may give them access to things that and make it easier to access things that you don't want them to whereas if they have to go directly through your router your router might actually have better security so one suggestion that i've seen is that you can keep your internet of things devices on a guest network so a lot of wi-fi routers have a guest network and then a regular network and so you could put your internet of things devices on your guest network although that may uh that may impact the convenience of accessing them and exactly what you can or can't do with them um internet of things cameras have also been found vulnerable to hacking so you know if you've got that camera in your home think about where you're placing it think about what would happen if a hacker were able to to get access to it um i know a lot of security experts who have the cameras on their laptops covered up um one internet of things company smart locks actually bricked when they did an update in this case it breaks such that the locks were always open it's kind of unclear to me whether that's better or worse than having the locks always locked but um yeah people were not able to lock their homes so that's kind of a problem and i think internet of things also provides a lot of privacy concerns so well i think the internet of things there's a lot of cool interesting fun stuff that's coming out related to the internet of things and i'm sure we're going to see more and more of these things as we move forward you know do be a little bit cautious think about who these different companies are that are creating these devices and whether or not you trust them to have good security and whether or not you think that they're concerned about your privacy all right that's it for today i'll talk to you all soon
