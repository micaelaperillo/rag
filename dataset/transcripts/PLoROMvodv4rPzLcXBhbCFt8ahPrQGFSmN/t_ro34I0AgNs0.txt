welcome to exploring computing today's video is web page example captions so in this video we're going to try and tie together everything you've learned so far with an extensive example you can see our web page here has some fairly standard formatting on particularly on the headings and then we've got those two images with some captions underneath them and that's really where the heart of this example is going to be there's a number of different key topics we're going to be covering first of all you may be wondering how to decide whether to use a type select or class select or an id selector so we'll take a look at that you may also be wondering whether you should use an external or an internal style sheet we'll see some examples of both of those in action we'll also take a look at how to use divs in a variety of different ways and also you'll notice that this particular web page is centered in the web browser and we'll show you how to do that right at the end of this video okay so the first thing we're going to do is set all our headings to sans serif we'll talk about sans serif when we're talking about web design later in the quarter but just for now you can see the difference between the standard appearance which is up on top which has serifs and then the bottom appearance which does not have serifs and you kind of see that bottom is a little bit cleaner again we'll talk about it in more detail another lecture now this particular design choice we want to apply to all the headings so that means we want to use some sort of a type selector and here's our type selector i'm sending the font family to sans serif and then the next question is should this go in an internal or external style sheet and the way to be thinking about internal versus external is is this a particular style you are likely to want to use throughout your website for all the web pages on your website or is this something specific to just this web page now probably we're going to want all the headings on our website to look the same and so this should go in an external style sheet all right in addition if you look at that h1 you'll notice that remember the h1 is the largest size heading up at the top of the page typically at the top of the page you'll see that it's centered and i've changed the colors it's pretty boring it's gray but i have i have changed the colors they're gray all right so here's how i've done that i've set the background color to gray i've set the foreground color to white i've also set the text align to center that's how that one's centered i've set the font size to a specific setting of my choice rather than using the default of the web browser i've also set the padding to 10 pixels so let's take a close look at the 10 pixels here what's the difference between setting the padding to 10 pixels versus setting the margin to 10 pixels well here we take a close-up of just the center of that heading we can see the difference so notice at the top that's what we actually have notice there's a lot of gray above and below the words whereas with the bottom setting which would just be if we set the margin to 10 pixels rather than the padding of 10 pixels there's a much thinner gray border and so what's happening here is that the background color is based on the padding so there's 10 pixels above and below that's included and covered by the background when i we set the padding to 10 pixels if we set the margin to 10 pixels that's the stuff outside of the border we haven't actually drawn a border here but basically the background color will not cover anything outside of the border including the margins and so that's why it appears much thinner on the bottom setting okay and assuming we want this h1 to apply to all the web pages on our website we probably do we would put this in an external style sheet okay there's a couple more things we've done with headings here they are right here the h2s have lines above and below them so we set that with text decoration um we've set the h3s to italics and again we want this across all of our web pages so this goes in the external style sheet if you look in the bottom left-hand corner you see a very small text there it's a little hard to read here on the actual web page it's still pretty small but it is readable if we zoom in we'll see that that gives credit for where i actually got the text the photos is you will probably not be surprised here are mine but that text was taken from wikipedia and so there's a couple questions to ask first of all should i use a div for this or should i use a paragraph or should i use something else and should i use a class for this or an id and in this particular case i don't think that there's a right answer i used a paragraph for it but if you wanted to use a div for it that that would make sense i gave it an id because i was assuming that there would be only one credits on the web page but you know if you thought you might want to use this credit setting in other places as well maybe you want to put credits on the photographs it might make sense to set this up as a class and you can see that for this particular id i set the font size to extra extra small and i also set the font family to sans serif so the text of the the body except for the headings and a few other places is serif but specifically the headings and this credit section is sans-serif okay let's go back to our big picture here and as i mentioned the main thing the big topic here that we're going to be talking about is these images so let's take a closer look at these images so if you look at the images you'll notice that there is actually the image and underneath that there's a caption uh there's a border surrounding the image and the caption and the caption is centered and in italic so we want to figure out how to do all of those okay the first thing i'm going to do is i want to treat the image and the caption as a group so i'm going to go ahead and create a div and place both the img tag and the caption into that div and i want these style elements to be the same for all the images and so i'm going to go ahead and create a class if we only want the styles to apply to single image we could give it an id but if we think it's going to be something we want on multiple images go ahead and give it a class and here's my initial take here you can see i've created a div and i've given a class photo and then also i want to do some additional styling on the caption and so i've given that a class as well class caption i think that i'm going to use the same styling information for all the different captions so i want to give it a class i've also put a height and a width in the img tag for each of these images this is actually so when the web page loads what's going to happen here is the html file is going to be received first uh the html file will probably refer well in this case we'll definitely refer to an external style sheet it will also refer to a bunch of imgs while the web browser is waiting for that style sheet to download while in particular it's waiting for those images to download it does not necessarily know how big the images are so what will happen is you'll get a small postage stamp size icon showing where the image is supposed to appear and then later when it figures out how big those images actually are it will resize the web page so by putting a specific hyphen width here on the img tag i am telling the web browser to go ahead and reserve space for that image so we'll go ahead and create a blank area for the image as big as the space i've specified and when the image finally downloads it will go ahead and fill it into that space you don't necessarily have to specify here on the img you could just specify it on the cast getting style sheets on the theory that until the cascading style sheet is downloaded anyway it's not going to know how to lay out the web pages we will be talking about extensively about how to layout web pages in the lecture there's also some tricks that you can play with different with different pixel densities on your images uh and we will may talk about that in another lecture it gets actually fairly complicated if you want to have oh here's the image that i want to use if this is in a low density situation where you know maybe it's a mid-range display or a mid-range television an hdtv it's been displaying on versus this is a super high quality retinal display on an ipad or something like that and i want two different images one where which takes up a lot of space and has a lot of pixels for that retinal display and then maybe another one for for the standard quality display we could talk about that in another lecture all right here's the rules that i'm going to use for the photo and the caption you can see that i've put a border around the photo and i've added a bit of padding and then i've told the caption it should be line center and the font style should be italic and this works for our little image here uh this is my um old karen terry molly the flow pep and this is in the middle of a dorm staff meeting uh nobody's paying attention and she's trying to sneak the snacks off the table while we're all talking so this works totally fine for that but on the other image uh this is what we want the other image to appear as and it turns out it doesn't actually work this is what happens so what happened here why did it work on one but not the other well what happened here is the image has a specific width but the text does not and what happens is because text has no natural width other than you know however long your sentence or paragraph is it will expand to take up as much space as available so the a two month karen terry puppy escapes from an enclosure that just expanded out it said i am just going to take as much space as is available until i can appear on one line or until i fill the entire web browser window so that's a problem so our solution for this is we're going to provide a specific width on that caption and so let's go back to our questions here should this be specified as a class or an id thing and should this be internal versus external well my thinking here is each of the images may have a different width so this isn't something that's going to be in common for all of my images now it's possible you're running some sort of newspaper and you just have a couple standard widths for all your images so in that case you might use a class but in this particular case i figured all my images could be a random width and so i'm going to go ahead and create a rule specifically for this image and so this means i'm going to give it an id and then as far as internal versus external well if this is something that's going to be in common across multiple web pages that's external in this case as i said i'm assuming my widths are going to be different from one image to another and that's specific just to this image and so there's no reason to put that in an external style sheet that's going to get downloaded by all my other web pages on my website this is specific to just this image and so i'm going to go ahead and provide a width i'm going to put it in the internal style sheet so you know there's my style start stop tags this is in the internal style sheet i you can see that i'm actually going to put the width on the caption but i'm going to put the id on the surrounding div and the idea here is you know maybe there's going to be some other things down the road that are going to be specific to this uh this particular image caption setup so by putting the id on that whole div i get a little bit more flexibility uh and so this particular rule combines the id it needs to be in the escape photo followed by the space followed by the dot caption so you recall this is actually a descendant selector it says this will apply to anything that is contained within a element with the id escape photo and somewhere within that escape photo div if there's some other element inside of that escape photo div that has the class captioned this will apply to it and so i went ahead and said okay that caption that fits it or if there's any other captions that fit this particular rule which there aren't in this case uh that's gonna be width 200 and then i figured you know we might want to change the caption on the other photo at some point so i might as well go ahead and specify width for that and this is pretty common practice the idea being you're the website designer you're the web page designer somebody else might change the contents of the web page at another time and so you should be thinking longer term like okay right now the image underneath right now that caption under the other photo that's not white enough to cause problems but it could be changed by a text editor later and they might not understand how to fix html css problems so better to just go ahead and specify both the widths right now okay we've got photos on the left and the right um this is seems like something that we would want to have on all our web pages so that suggests it should be a class and so i've gone ahead and specified it on my divs here i have a right photo and a left photo class notice that the class actually specifies that it is both a photo which we saw the rules for before and a right photo or a left photo so i didn't really mention this previously but you can list multiple classes on your class attribute value pair in your tags so i think this is a little odd i think they should have separated them by commas but they didn't so just list as many classes as you want just separate them by spaces and then here's the rules for the left and the right photo basically i'm floating to the left or floating to the right and then i'm specifically setting a margin either on the left or the right basically the margin is on the opposite side of where it's floating so the idea here is it will be flush to the left and then on the right side where the text is flowing alongside i want a little bit of a margin between the photo and the text or if the photo has flirted to the right i want it flush on the right side of the web page with a little bit of margin between on the left where the text is flowing alongside okay you'll also notice that the web page is centered in the web browser this is pretty common how do you do that usually what you're going to do is you're going to add an extra div the div is going to surround absolutely everything in the body so you can see i have the outer body tag and then inside of the body tag i have a div i've given it the id all and everything in the web page is in that inner div and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to write a rule for that inner div and here it is i say oh this is for all and i gave it a specific width i said the entire content should fill a thousand pixels and then i set the margin to auto margin auto allows the web browser to choose the margins on its own and what that will usually do for the left and the right margin is just even out the left and right margin and place the item in the center so that gives us this nice effect another thing that these are sometimes used for these outer divs are sometimes used for is if you want to put a box around the entire webpage you could go ahead and put a border around it at all and you would get a nice little back uh border around the entire thing okay um that's just about it the last thing i wanted to mention is this use of divs uh is super flexible we'll take a look at this again next lecture and you get to play around with a little bit in the next homework assignment uh but i did want to mention for the more advanced students the students that are planning to actually start creating real websites particularly if you're planning to do this in a professional setting you should be aware that html5 has added some new tags which can be used in place of these divs these pretty much will do the same thing as the divs that i created here the div for the caption the div for the uh the image and the caption together they don't generally have any styling information on their own but they are used to tell the web browser the sort of semantic information about what this tag is supposed to be and these can be very helpful for supporting viewers with accessibility problems particularly if somebody can't see the screen they're using what's called a a reader where the web browser is reading the contents of them these can be super helpful to let those readers know what's going on so in this particular case there's a figure and a fig caption um tag and so these could replace my two divs the div for the caption obviously where i said class equals caption that could be replaced by fig caption and then the outer one with a photo that could have been replaced by a figure and then here's a list of uh some of the other semantic elements i mentioned a couple of these i think before so there's an article uh a side is sort of like um if you've seen those textbooks where there's a sort of like a blue box you can kind of see my lame version of that in some of the chapters from the cs105 course reader where i just mark hey this is should go site but i didn't actually put it in an external box details section summary and time and then these might actually do something for uh the web browser on the bottom here nav that's super helpful for people again that can't actually read your web page or are having the web page read to them so nav indicates that a section is actually a navigational section so if you've got you know those we'll talk about this later but if you've got that common design where you've got a sidebar or a top navigation bar where you say hey here are some elements other here are some other web pages on my website that you can click on by having that nav there you can let the web browser know hey don't read this section to the person that's visiting my web page until they specifically say okay i'm done listening to what the contents of the web page are what are my navigation options and then the web browser can be like oh i see you have that nav section now's where i'm going to go ahead and read the nav section to my viewer and then there's a header and a footer which could be potentially used by the web browser due to something special in the top and the bottom i don't think it actually is used for anything right now it's just a another tag that you can use that you can give style rules to the same way i've given star rules to my div with class equals photo and my div with caption so these are all different options and again by providing a little bit more semantic information you'll make it a little bit easier for the web browser to tell what it is you're trying to do you'll also potentially make it easier for people like if you create a web design let's say you go this actually happens to uh some of my students you go to some some company let's see you start up a new non-profit with a bunch of friends nobody knows how to make a web page you're it and so you go and make the web page but you might want other people to be able to modify that web page so by by using these special tags you can let people know what the different parts of your html file are to be used for you're providing them a little bit more guidance uh in terms of what the individual sections are rather than just having a bunch of divs okay that's it um i'll talk to you guys soon we've got a lot more cool web stuff coming we've got extensive discussion on layout so you know i think this is already a pretty interesting web page but um we've actually got uh an extensive discussion on layouts followed by how to use the the technologies i'm going to be teaching you to recreate parts of the new york times web page and the washington post webpage so you can look forward to that i'll talk to you soon you
