welcome to exploring computing today's video is introduction to html creating a web page step by step now this example web page we're showing right here we aren't going to quite get to that level of sophistication today but we will very shortly because that's actually on next week's homework assignment for now we're going to start off with something simpler so in the previous video we talked about what html was and we talked a bit about the different roles of html what we're going to do now is walk you through what you need to do in order to actually create your own html web page so the first thing we need to do is we need to get a text editor now i need to clarify that a text editor is not the same as a word processor so something like microsoft word is designed to create formatted documents using a process called what you see is what you get where when you're editing it you can actually see what the print page is going to look like it turns out this doesn't work that great with web pages because what you see is not what you get with a normal text document you actually have complete control over what this printed page is going to look like you have control over the device you're going to print it on you have control over the size of the page none of that happens in html you are creating a web page that will be seen on many different devices with many different characteristics so this what you see is what you get are as we sometimes refer to computer science wysiwyg does not work well for web pages so we want to use a text editor and there's a variety of different text editors that are out there i'm going to recommend using visual studio code you can find it by just googling it i should clarify that visual studio code is different from visual studio they're both products of microsoft and they run on macintosh windows and linux and they're used by professionals so um this is a really great text editor it's used by a lot of professionals and it's free so win-win-win but you can use other text editors sublime and adam are two other text editors that will run on any of the different platforms you might be on and are used by professionals if you're on the macintosh using text wrangler or bb edit is totally fine if you're on the pc if you've got something like notepad plus plus that's fine as well the key point here is you want to use a text editor not something that edits rich text meaning text with bold and italic and things like that if your text editor shows content that has bold and italic in it that's not the kind of text editor you want in particular macintosh users should not use text edit that's the standard built in text editor for macintosh text edit has direct support for rich text it's possible to use text edit for creating html if you know what you're doing but it's a little confusing on actually how to do it and we found many students have trouble with it so we strongly do not recommend that you use textedit so again i recommend microsoft visual studio code it will run on both macs and pcs but there are a variety of other text editors you can use make sure it's a text editor and do not use the standard macintosh text edit you should also consider turning on file extensions display in your operating system computer setup for consumers don't show file extensions and so these are things like txt dot html dot doc dot pdf these go on the ends of files and they indicate what type of file it is and typically if a computer is set up for consumers it's going to be hidden this is going to get a bit confusing though when we're working on with our web pages and we're doing programming so for the next couple months you guys are going to be doing some programming work and i do recommend that you turn on file extensions and you can see here on my images here on the left i have the file extensions on and on the right i have the file extensions off even though there are several files that appear to have the same name they're actually different because they have different extensions and so it is easier telling what's going on with the file extensions are on i do recommend you turn them on i'm not going to go over actually how to turn them on since it is quite different from one operating system to another and i just recommend you just go ahead and google it okay so here's the basic steps we're going to use to create and edit web pages we're going to start with a starter file so i'm going to provide you with a starter file i recommend you start with that you're going to add your text you're going to validate it for syntax errors so this is errors in the tags that we talked about in the previous lecture once you complete getting rid of all the syntax errors then you're going to try and load it into your web browser you're going to see if you like what the result is and if you like the result great you're done or you can continue extending it if you think there's a problem with how it appears you need to go back to step two and edit your text revalidate it reload it in the web browser and so on so let's go over each of these individual steps so as i mentioned i do recommend you start with a starter file we will providing you with a starter file there's no need to memorize all the structural information that appears in every html file if this were a regular quarter we would actually provide the structural information for you on the midterm and the final but since there's no midterm or final you don't have to worry about that at all anyway use the starter file there's no reason to memorize all this stuff okay once you have your starter file in hand you need to open it up in your text editor now the thing about html files is if you just double click on an html file it's going to open up in the web browser it's not going to open it up in the text editor so you need to explicitly open up the html file in your text editor so there's a variety of ways to do this probably the most straightforward method is to go up to the text editor's file menu and choose open and go to wherever your starter file is i commonly actually just drag the file over from the desktop finder desktop if you're on pc finder if you're on the macintosh i just drag grab that file icon and just drag it into the text editor you're welcome to do it any way you want just remember if you double click on that file it's going to open it up in the web browser which is not what you want you want it open up in the text editor okay so you've got your starter file you've got in your text editor just go ahead and edit it and add in some text and so here's my example here and i've added it and it looks great now it turns out that once you've done that you could just open up your web browser but we don't recommend this we recommend an extra step and this extra step is actually going to save you a great number of points over the quarter on your homework so definitely take this next step this next step is validating your html file so what a validator is is it's a program that is designed to look through your html file and find any errors on that html file the thing to keep in mind is web browsers are not designed to show errors on a web page if i'm visiting somebody's web page like let's say i go to the new york times i go to amazon if that web page has errors on it and there are a shocking number of professional web pages that have what might be considered errors often they're there because there's some new extension that's not actually technically part of the language yet that they want to play with or there's old legacy stuff that shouldn't really be there anymore but they leave it in there but anyway you know if i visit one of these web pages and there's an error in it do i want to know about it no it's not my web page so web browsers are designed primarily for consumers not for web developers there are ways that we can turn on some error messages in the web browser but the easiest thing to do is just to use this validation process so remember the web browser is not going to tell you if there are errors on your web page it's just going to happily ignore them now one thing you might be wondering is if my web page has supposedly has errors and i can't actually see them do they matter and here's the thing different web browsers will interpret erroneous code differently so it could be that the web browser that you're viewing your errors in more or less figures it out which is you're trying to do and your web page looks perfectly normal in that web browser but if we're professionals we need to check it on a wide range of web browsers we're not supporting just one web browser we're supporting many web browsers we need to support chrome safari firefox edge and then we need to support a different number of hardware platforms so windows mac os ios android and then each of these different devices is going to potentially display webpage differently depending on what version of the operating system i'm using or what version of the web browser i'm using and so we were professionals we would have rooms of different hardware devices with different software installed on it so we could check our web page against all these different options we're not going to do that for our class but by validating your file by making sure that there are no errors in your file you are greatly reducing the chances that your file is going to appear differently in one of these web browsers so definitely validate your file and we're going to validate your file and if you have errors in your file when we validate it you're going to lose points so if for no other reason validate your file because otherwise you're going to lose homework points okay so there's a variety of different ways to validate your file we're going to use an online service from the world wide web consortium this is the official consortium that's in charge of web standards and so you can see the url for it here on on the screen and so in the right this is what the validator service looks like and in the middle tab there's something that's marked file upload you want to select that that's going to allow us to upload a file from our computer to the world wide web consortiums validator service where it can check on their computer and see if there are any errors in our file so go ahead and check on that after you click on that you'll also see a series of check boxes i recommend that you check the box that says show source that's going to make it a little bit easier telling what's going on one of the nice things about showing the source is it does show you where the individual line numbers are and you can compare that to the error numbers but if you're using a good text editor like visual studio code that will show you the line numbers as well anyway key point here is just go to validator.w3.org notice that's org this is a non-profit organization and upload your file there and check it out so here's what the results will look like this is a modified version of the html file i showed a couple minutes ago the html file i showed you a couple minutes ago doesn't have any errors but um i wanted to shift some errors so i modified it and put in a bunch of errors and this is what it's going to look like when you have errors now a couple things about having errors first of all everybody has errors in their code that's particularly going to be true when we start programming but it's also going to be true for your html so you know if you have errors in your code congratulations you're human second you may end up with what appears to be a lot of errors don't be intimidated by lots and lots of errors typically what's going to happen as soon as there's one or two errors at somewhere at the beginning of your code it causes a cascading sequence of problems for the validator so you know if you see 35 errors there's probably only three probably what happened was those first couple errors caused the validator to not understand what's going on and now it's marking a bunch of stuff as errors when it's not actually error so you know just don't get intimidated if there's a huge number of errors take out the first error you know you can revalidate it then and see how many errors that takes out of your list it's likely to take out more than one error on the list so you know don't be shocked if there's a lot of errors that listed by the validator that doesn't mean those are actually all real errors start with the first one on the list also the validator will often notice the error on the line after the error has occurred what's happening here is the validator is looking for a particular thing in the code and it's expecting it to occur on the previous line and it's not until it gets to the next line when it realizes hey i didn't see that thing so for example you know we've talked about how attribute value pairs the value should have quotes around it and so what can happen is you have a starting quote you forget to put the ending quote it's looking for that ending quote it's looking for the ending quote it's not until it gets to the next line when it says hey i think i should have seen a quote i see you're starting a new tag here didn't we need to end the previous tag and that's where it's going to mark the error so often the error will occur on the line before the line number the validator actually marks okay now we've validated our code we've removed all the errors and you're you're there's a little cycle here where you're going to go ahead and try to validate you're going to find some errors you're going to add your code you're going to revalidate you're going to find some errors you're going to change your code and you're just going to have to cycle through that until you've removed all the errors let's say we removed all the errors okay now we're going to load it into the web browser so as i as i mentioned earlier web browsers all actually act a little bit differently for the web pages we're making this is unlikely to occur but it may occur so if we were professionals we would be testing in a whole bunch of different web browsers on a whole bunch of different hardware platforms we're not going to do that for our class we want to use one standardized web browser and so we're going to use firefox so get the latest version of firefox that's what we're going to be grading it on all right to open it up again don't double click it you know depending on how your computer is set up there's a variety of different web browsers that are probably the standard web browser you use for day-to-day browsing and that's what it's going to open it in instead start at firefox go to file open or drag the file into firefox while it's open and uh just drag it from the desktop finder into the web browser and it will go ahead and open it up okay it looks great great we're done or great and i want to add some more to it and i want to enhance it either way there is this continuing process where i edit the code i revalidate i load it into the web browser i see their problems or if i want to enhance it and so there's this cycle it's called the edit debug cycle and this is something that programmers actually spend large parts of their day working on so it's definitely something you're going to be doing when you start working on web pages all right so that's it for our basics on how to make some web pages and you'll get a chance to practice with this on the next homework assignment which will be coming out soon you
