welcome to exploring computing today's video is computer networks part one hardware so we've been looking at individual computers and how individual computers work but one of the things that makes computers extremely useful particularly given her current situation is the fact that they're all working together on the network and so we're going to start by looking at computer network hardware and then we're going to take a look at how to identify computers on the network and then we're going to move up to the different rules that regulate how networks work together and then finally we're going to end by talking about how the worldwide web works and so this is going to take several different lectures but for starts let's take a look at the actual physical way that computers are hooked together to form a network so when i'm going to form a network of computers i need to worry about two different things i need to worry about what the network topology is which is to say what is the geometric configuration of computers and then i need to worry about what medium i'm using to connect the computer together so that's talking about like are the computers being hooked together using electromagnetic waves am i using optical cables am i using copper fiber what specific medium am i using to connect these computers together here are three different classic topologies and there are many many more these are just three classic examples so i've got a star network a ring network and a bus network you can see that the star network has a single node in the middle and then a bunch of nodes on the outside and actually you are all quite familiar with this network because it turns out that this particular network is the type of network that wi-fi uses so if you kind of think about it you've got a bunch of people in your house or you've got a couple people in the classroom and they're all on the internet and somewhere in that room or in the nearby room is the wi-fi router and so all the computers talk to that individual wi-fi router and if the individual wi-fi router goes down nobody can talk to each other so that's a star network a ring network as you can see here we have a bunch of computers and they're all hooked with one following the next following the next following the next and so depending upon how many nodes you have this actually takes less connection medium than our star network does ring networks are commonly used for example with optical cables one of the problems with the ring network at least is the way they typically work is if one of the nodes goes down this messages stop traveling around the ring you can certainly imagine having a ring where if one of the nodes went down the messages started going in the opposite direction but that's not typically how they work and then finally our last example here is the bus network and on a bus network all the computers are connected to a common cable this sort of network used to be quite common connecting computers together say in a classroom bus networks also have their own set of problems and in fact each of these networks is going to have to have different rules for how they govern and how they work and so one of the problems with the bus network is if multiple computers on the network try to send out a signal at the same time you have a problem where there's contention on the line and the network needs to have rules for what happens when two computers are simultaneously trying to use that that bus so one question we can ask ourselves is what kind of we so we've seen three different types of networks here what kind of network is the internet and that actually turns out to be a trip question because the internet is not a single network it is actually a network composed of different networks so this is what we refer to as an internetwork and so here i've got a drawing of a network of networks this is the sort of thing that might connect different people on campus so you know we might have a set of optical fiber cables connecting the different buildings in the university and so we've got like a ring connecting each of those and then we might go from there to a bus network connecting different floors on a particular building and then those individual floors might have their own bus networks so we have a bus network connect to a bus network and ultimately for convenience somewhere on that bus network we need to have our wi-fi router and then we have different people connected into the wi-fi router so this is just a small example of an internetwork but in fact the internet itself is composed like this with different networks connected to different networks connected to different networks now there's different types of hardware you may run into when we're working with our internetworks and so one of the devices is a bridge and a bridge is used to connect two different networks that are of the same type so you can imagine this is simpler than connecting different networks of different types and so say we have one bus network that's running across all the dorms in a particular complex so say we have a bus connecting all the dorms in stern or all the dorms in flomo and then each of the individual houses might have their own network and so we would need a bridge to connect one of those networks to the other network if we have two different types of networks connected together we need a fancier piece of equipment and so a router connects two different types of networks this is probably most famous for wireless router so if you hear people talk about wireless router that is a device that connects the wireless network the wi-fi network to some other type of network you may also hear the term gateway or gateway computer a gateway computer is a computer that basically acts similar to a router or a bridge it connects different networks together the difference being that the router or the bridge is a very special purpose box that that's its only purpose in life is handling these messages whereas a gateway computer is a general purpose computer that among other things handles network traffic now we're not going to talk too much about the different mediums that are available to connect our computers together you know there's a wide range ranging from plain old telephone service or pots which is the traditional copper cables used for for telephone services ranging up to cable networks to fiber optic cables to wi-fi to satellite these all are different mediums and there are different ways we can connect the computers in our network one of the issues that comes up though when we're talking about different mediums is the bandwidth and so what the bandwidth is what the bandwidth originally referred to i suppose technically still does although computer scientists tend not to talk about it this way is the band of frequency that's set aside for that particular communication to take place so the wider the frequency band we have available the more messages we can send through computer scientists and generally colloquially most people refer to bandwidth as just the speed of the network so if i have a lot of bandwidth that means i can send a lot of information quickly if i don't have a lot of bandwidth then i can't send messages very quickly you may also hear the terms broadband and narrowband narrowband basically is plain old telephone line and plain old telephone service or pot as it's technically referred to i actually think it's kind of a cute name pods um you know that has very low bandwidth and we can't send much information through it and in fact as we saw in one of our previous videos if we want to send a five minute cd song over pots it's gonna take about five hours so that's pretty bad the term that you'll hear more frequently is broadband and this just refers to something that's not narrowband generally these terms aren't in widespread use anymore except for there's a fair number of companies that have the name broadband in it because it used to be really cool to be broadband instead of narrowband but now everybody's broadband so you will still hear the term broadband banding around mostly in the names of various companies that are out there but that's what they're referring to here's some more terms you might run into lan stands for local area network that's a small network so if we have a classroom we have a bunch of computers hooked together in that classroom we might have a lan if you play computer games or you have friends that play computer games you may hear them refer to a lan party this is a party where people bring their computers and get them networked together to play computer games we used to do these back in the day when stanford changed its drinking policy at one point we were trying to provide students with things to do other than drink and so one of the activities the rcc started having lan parties for for campus that was kind of cool you may also hear about wide area networks these are networks that connect cities across continents or even across continents you may also hear the term man metropolitan area network this is a network within a city so if you have a friend that's saying i need to find a good man they might be referring to wanting to find a good guy or they might be thinking about uh which city they want to move to after graduation and making sure that that city has a good metropolitan area network i'll have to admit i've actually never seen man in use in this usage other than in network textbooks but i'm fond of this joke so you guys will have to put up with it another term you might run into is hops as we talked about earlier the internet is not a single network it's actually a network of networks and so hops is referring to how many networks my message needs to go through in order to get to this destination so if if i'm trying to communicate with a friend say at harvard my message is going to have to go through many hops as it goes from the stanford networks out to stanford's connection with the wider internet that goes through a bunch of internet backbone providers it goes back out the other side to you know to get into the harvard network it probably has to hop through a couple different networks at harvard so these are all different things that the message has to do in order to get to this destination and what's going to happen here is there's a number of different things that's going to determine how fast a message or data travels through the internet one is going to be the connection medium so if i've got like fiber optic cable that is going to be much faster than say plain old telephone service pods but the other issue that's going to occur is every time message traffic goes from one network to the next network there's also going to be delay because whatever we're using to connect those two networks together needs to spend some time looking at that message figuring out is this a message that's supposed to be going to someone on my network is this getting passed to another network how does this need to get from this network to the other network and so there's a delay because this actual processing has to take place so the more hops we go through the longer the message is going to take to get there on a related note you may hear people referring to lag and latency generally speaking lag refers to the perception that the message is getting passed very slowly for example one of the things that i used to do as a resident fellow was when we were interviewing for new ras we would sometimes interview people at various stanford overseas being overseas programs and you would notice sometimes there would be a long lag between when you someone spoke and when you actually heard their words and so this is lag this is the appearance that the network is not doing well another time you'll hear the term lag is um you know you have a friend who plays first-person shooters and they're like that wasn't my fault it was a lag actually it was their fault they sucked but the idea here is you know they tried to move their character in a particular direction and because of the delay in network traffic they ended up getting shot it wasn't because they didn't move quickly enough it was because the message had to travel through too many slow connections or too many hops or there's just too much we'll talk about this next lecture there was too much too many other packets traveling through the same network um anyway so the end result was um the information that they moved did not get to the server in time the term latency generally is a slightly more technical term referring to the amount of delay involved in the transmission but these two are often used more or less synonymously i should mention that lag and latency are not necessarily directly related to the speed of the connection and so the idea here is you could have a lot of bandwidth and you could still have lag and latency and so here's an example here suppose we are sending a message from earth to a spaceship traveling around mars okay we've got several different things that we need to think about here you know how much bandwidth do we have like let's say i'm sending a new copy of the latest movie out i don't know i guess there aren't any movies out right now but let's let's pretend mulan is out and i've got an astronaut out there and she really loves mulan uh she loves the cartoon version of mulan and the new live live-action version of mulan is out and we want to send to her a copy and she's out of mars so if we have slow bandwidth it is going to take a long time for that entire movie to reach this destination regardless of how far away that person is so let's say two of us are on the same network there's no hops between us but we're connected by a plain old telephone line it's going to take a long time for that movie to transmit over that telephone line on the other hand if we have a really fast connection because this person's really close to us it's going to transfer very quickly now let's look at the situation we're sending the data to mars regardless of how much bandwidth we have it is still going to take a very long time for those first bits to reach mars and if we have high bandwidth once those first bits reach mars the rest of the bits will follow very quickly if we have low bandwidth we still have the same delay because you know it just takes a certain amount of time for light to travel to mars but if we've got a low bandwidth once those bits start reaching mars they're going to have to wait a long time between when the first bit hits there and when the last bit hits there so the point of this is there's different issues involved here it's not just a matter of hey i have really high bandwidth connection or i have a really low bandwidth connection yes those are important but there's also a question of how far away is this person how many hops does this have to go through and things like that and that's actually going to be an issue when you start worrying about things like web servers um we typically don't get into this but uh you know since i've got a captive audience here one of the issues that comes up is if i've got a web server and that web server is say in california and my customer is in australia there's a pretty long delay where the message needs to get transferred from my server here in california through a whole bunch of hops to get to australia and so a better way to handle this is to use something called a content delivery network or cdn and what a cdn does is it takes the files that would normally be in my server here in california and it distributes to a whole bunch of different servers around the world so there will be a server in australia or oceana there will be a server in say asia there will be server in europe and they'll be serving in the united states there'll be server in africa and wherever the person is trying to access our information from they will get it from the near server and so you know there will be fewer hops to get to that server there will be less lag there will be less latency and the information will get to them much faster so if you're going to come up with a server and you think that you're going to have a global audience contracting out to content delivery network might be a great idea all right so that's it for now in the next lecture we're going to talk about how to identify individual computers on the network and the next lecture on friday we're going to talk take a look at different protocols that are used governing how information travels through the internet i'll see you again soon
