welcome to exploring computing today's video is linking web pages part 1 making links so this is going to be the first in a series of videos where we're going to take a look at different aspects of creating web pages combining both the html and the cascading style sheets and of course one of the things that makes the web really interesting is the fact that we can link one web page to another web page remember that's one of the key part parts of hypertext markup and language the hypertext component so we're going to go ahead and start off with that now we have already talked a little bit about how to make links between web pages but it's going to turn out that there's a lot more to it both strictly on the html side and also when combining it with cascading style sheets so let's go ahead and get started so here i've got a diagram representing that we've got a computer www.stanford.edu and it has a bunch of files in it and we're going to assume that these files are all in the same folder and that they are in the top level directory for whatever www.stanford.edu is using to serve up web pages and i'll talk a little bit more detail about uh how that works a little bit later but for now just uh we're trying to keep things simple so we've got these two files and they are in the main location where the www.stanford.edu server is going to be serving up files so i've got a laptop i'm going to go ahead and visit and i'm going to have the example.html file sent to me and so remember what we're looking at here is how to create links between pages so what we're going to take a look at is let's say uh i'm i'm currently viewing the web page associated with the example.html file that has been downloaded on my laptop and now um that web page example.html has a reference to another webpage and it's got a reference to the another.html webpage and so this is what the link might look like and we've seen this before so um you know this says oh i've got a hypertext transfer protocol request for the web server www.stanford.edu and i want to get to the file another.html and then the text another web page which is between the a start and the a n tag that's text that's going to be linked we'll talk a little bit later about what it's going to look like and how we might change the appearance okay turns out that we can actually shorten this and instead of saying www.stanford.edu another.html we can just say another.html and this is what it's referred to as a relative reference what we had before where we had the full thing including the web server and the protocol http that's what we refer to as an absolute reference you have this choice when you're linking from one web page to another web page you need to decide am i going to use an absolute reference with the full http and the server or are you going to have a relative reference for you just have the name of the file and the assumption with a relative reference is that that file that you are referring to because remember this is a reference to another.html from the file example.html which currently is residing with a copy both on the server and a copy that has been sent to my laptop the assumption is that i am referring to another.html file that is on the same server as the example.html file that i'm currently looking at and it's also in the same folder now it is possible to have different folders so if i am viewing example.html and on the server it's located in a directory or folder that has a second folder or directory folder and directory are synonymous and that folder's name is articles and the articles folder has a file called another.html on it then you can see i can use this relative reference here so i can say articles slash another.html so the article slash with the slash immediately after it indicates that that's a director or folder i should mention that there are operating systems that use other delimiters to indicate folders so for example windows most notably uses the backslash the macintosh used to use colons before they got to os x and switched over to underlying operating system being unix but regardless of what the underlying operating system of either the the client the web client meaning my laptop or the web server meaning www.stanford.edu regardless of the operating system for either of those when we're talking about web stuff we're always going to use that standard slash okay so um so i'm going to go ahead and say hey you know that this links to a file on the same computer on the same server as the current file that i'm viewing but it's in a sub directory it's in the article subdirectory and this is going to actually work whether we have a relative or an absolute reference but here i'm doing it with a relative reference so one question that comes up is do i want to use an absolute reference or a relative reference and here's the thing if if i want to link to another web server so here i'm trying to link to an article on the new york times server that actually needs to be done with an absolute reference there's no way to have a relative reference from one server to another so right there that's one clear distinction so i can do everything i want with absolute references why would i ever want to use a relative reference well it turns out that there's actually a bunch of big benefits to using relative references so one of the benefits of having relative references is that they're much more portable and so what i mean by this is if i have a website and all the references between the different web pages on the website are using relative references i can take all those files and those folders and move them to another computer so here's an example of why that might be useful so a while back carnegie mellon was having financial difficulties actually all the universities were um i think this was at the 2008 stock market crash and they ended up letting all their lecturers go now suppose the same thing happened to stanford and i had a great website that was sitting on the stanford servers and i had all these different files and they were all linked together and i ended up having to go to harvard because stanford was out of money and let me go well if i have absolute references in this website and i take it to harvard which is pretty standard practice uh universities will typically let you take your material with you so i i take my material i take it to harvard and you know if i'm using absolute references in my material that means every time i have a link from one web page to another web page within my website it says http web.stanford.edu and i'm going to have to go in there and erase the stanford and replace it with harvard and you know i'm just going to be bawling my eyes out because you know harvard's good but it's not stanford and so by using those absolute references moving it from one server to another i've completely broken every single reference in contrast if i'm using relative references every time i refer from one webpage to another web page it's not it doesn't have the full url it doesn't have web.stanford.edu it just says hey there's this other file it's in the same folder or maybe it's in a subfolder but those links are all still working so i can take my entire website i can move it to the harvard server and all the internal links are still working i'm still pretty sad of course but you know at least i don't have to go in and delete all the references to stanford and replace them at another advantage of relative references is relative references are shorter that's nice from a typing standpoint you don't have to type http colon slash slash name of server slash um it's also going to be a bit cheaper and this can add up over time because you're serving up fewer bits right those extra bits for the http and the name of the server those aren't in the files your your html files are just a tad bit shorter they're you're gonna pay a bit less money for your bandwidth and um you know it'll be slightly faster it's nice it's not it's not a huge win but it is a win and there's no cost so it's all win all right so generally there's a lot of advantages to using relative references the main reason why we use an absolute references as we just saw if you're trying to link to another web server like if i've got a link from my stanford website to the new york times dot com website well i don't really have any choice i can't create a relative reference from one server to another relative references only work within a server so use an absolute reference then okay you may notice a a fair number of urls where they don't actually specify the file name so www.stanford.edu you know that says it's on the www.stanford server it doesn't say what the file is and you know you could go to w this this isn't actually a real url so don't try this one of five students there's actually a couple more subdirectories but um i thought i'd shorten it to keep the example simple uh www.stanford.edu cs105 um it's not specifying the name of a file and so all web servers have a particular default file that they're going to serve up most servers use the file index.html so there's a file in the directory called index.html and somebody does not specify a file name they specify folder name but they don't specify file name the index.html is going to get served up so that's sort of your default name there are some other names used for this but index.html is the most common you may also see it a web server some use home.html or some of them use and then in fact some of them actually don't use html they just use dot htm you can actually blame microsoft for this way back in the day all files on microsoft systems had to be named but what was called 8.38 letters and three letters after the dot i just it's pretty shocking to me that seems super limited having only eight characters but that's the way it was but hey it's all good bill gates seems to be doing good stuff plus the building that i can't go to anymore is named after him because they've donated much money to it for that too but um yeah happy thoughts to bill for his work on the uh uh philanthropy for for medical purposes good job dylan melinda okay now this thing that we've been typing here http stanford.edu another.html this is what's referred to as a url or a uniform resource locator it turns out that there's a second version of this where instead of using http you use https this is a secure version of http we'll be talking about it in much more detail on exactly what it's all about when we spend our week talking about computer security a little bit later on down the line it turns out that our url uniform resource locator is actually a subset of a much bigger standard called uri for uniform resource identifier and there's a whole bunch of uris and some of these are actually kind of handy um probably the handiest of them is the mailto uri and you can use this to create a link on your web page where somebody clicks on the link and they mail a message to you um this does assume that the web browser is set up to use mail [Music] and you could specify in addition to specifying the address to send it to you can specify other things like the subject you can cc some people you can put a body on there i do want to caution you um be careful about putting email addresses up on the internet you will notice that our and by r i mean none of the cs105 or cs106e teaching staff addresses are up there and that's actually because there are programs that surf the web looking for email addresses and put them on spamless it's too late for me i get a ton of spam although since the computer science department moves this to google's g suite google seems to have taken care of most of it they also occasionally take real emails sent by students and dump it in the spam folder so that part's not so good but they mostly got rid of all the spam i get i used to get a ton of spam all the time and occasionally i get in lists where i would get spam messages like every five minutes it was just freaking horrible anyway so if you put your email address on web pages and it's clearly obviously an email address these programs will grab them and stuff you on spam lists so be super cautious on there but you know if your business uh you know maybe it's worth it for you to have it super convenient for people to email uh an address an email address associated with companies you're just going to go ahead and stick that up there and using this mailto uri you can make it really easy for somebody to email you um there's a bunch of other types of uri so there's a ftp it's cure ftp there's facetime so you click on a link it starts at facetime and you click on the link start at sub skype um gamers there's even one that starts up steam so there's all sorts of different uris up there one of the uris that you may see is this file uri and in fact if you're loading a file into the web browser and that file is on your current computer this is basically what you're going to see so file colon slash slash and then the c colon that's that's windows for the current uh domain main hard disk this works when it's on your computer but don't use it um it's specific to a specific location on your computer it's completely not portable so we talked about how relative links are portable this is completely not portable and one of the things that it being completely not portable it's going to cause you problems is when you take your files you zip them up and submit them for your homework assignments and the ta unzips them on their computer those files are no longer on those files are no longer in the same location as they were when you zip them up and so this is going to completely break all your stuff for grading purposes so you know generally don't use it it's a bad idea and it's especially a bad idea for our class because you'll lose points for grading that's it for this video in the next video we're going to take a look at how to style our links uh changing the colors and changing the appearance of them i'll see you then
