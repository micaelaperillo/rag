welcome to exploring computing today's video is introduction to python our first python program so in the last video we saw how we could use the python shell as basically a super calculator and we played around with a bunch of different formulas like celsius times 9 divided by 5 plus 32 are kilometers times 0.621 but the way we were doing it last time we had a bit of a problem because we need to re-type these formulas every time we want to use them and so you know as i suggest the last time you can use the python shell as as basically super calculator but that's not really creating a program in order to turn these into programs we need to store them into a file and be able to reuse them whenever we want so it turns out that idle has a built-in file editor as i suggested last last video and so if you if you're running idle um see last video for how instructions for how to run idle um so if you go to the file menu there's an option there to create a new file so if you go ahead and do that the editor will start up and you will see what's being shown on the bottom right now our first attempt here could be just um to retype what we were previously typing into the python shell so remember last time we started out with just basically adding a bunch of numbers together so say i say 3 plus two and go ahead and put that into our editor here and when we try and run it by going to the run menu in the editor and saying run module it it's gonna ask us if we wanna save the file i'm gonna go ahead and save the file as example.py python files are stored with the extension py and then if i go ahead and run it by again choosing run run module it does not do what i expect here's what's actually going to show up so if you look at that line with a restart on there you kind of see it is attempting to run my example.py file but there's no output what's going on here well in our python programs we need to explicitly tell python that we want to output to our shell interpreter so i can do that with what's called a print function and so here here it is right here i'm going to say print and then i have a pair of parentheses and between the parentheses i say what i want it to print in this case i want it to print three plus two so i say print parentheses three plus two and now if i run it sure enough if you look down there at the second time i've run it you can see that it is printing a five so this is doing what we want now here i'm i'm printing the results of carrying on a mathematical equation i can output other things remember last lecture we talked about the fact that python works with integers it works with floating point numbers it also works with strings which allows to manipulate text and so what i've got down here at the bottom print quote go stanford quote remember those quotes indicate that i have a string of characters g o space s t a and f o r and d rather than i've got some variable named go and a variable name stanford and so if i go ahead and say print and i tell it to print the string go stanford in fact that's exactly what it'll do so i had print three plus two and i had print go stanford and if we look down here at the bottom you can see it printed both of those okay so last lecture we converted celsius to fahrenheit so let's create a little program that does this conversion for us here's my first attempt at doing this okay i go ahead and create a variable called celsius i store 30 in it um i carry out my little calculation there and store the result in the variable fahrenheit and then i've got a fancier slightly fancier version of the print statement here quote temperature and fahrenheit is end quote comma and then the name of the variable fahrenheit and that's actually going to print both of these items out it's going to print the string temperature and fahrenheit is and then it's going to go ahead and print fahrenheit and if we go ahead and go to the run menu in the editor and we choose run module sure enough this works it says temperature it's in fahrenheit is 86 degrees so that works but there's a bit of a problem here and that is my program here includes setting the celsius variable to 30. so if it's always 30 degrees out this program works but you know if it is always 30 degrees out that's not super useful anyway because i'll probably figure out that's 86 degrees fahrenheit soon enough if it's 30 degrees every day so um i want this to change so that instead of always running with celsius equals 30 i run with different temperatures in celsius and in order to do that i need to get input from the user and so that's our next step to get input from the user i'm going to use this new input function here i'm going to say input i've got a pair of parentheses and inside that pair of parentheses i'm going to put a string there that is going to prompt the user for the information we want so in our little example here i'm telling the user that i want information from them but i want them to know that the information i want from them is their name and when i go ahead and and execute this input function it's going to return a value to me that i can store into a variable so you know i generally want to say input enter your name i would actually do what i've got down here in the bottom here i would say user underscore name remember you can use the underscore in variables uh user underscore name equals input enter your name and so what this code here would do is it would prompt the user it would tell the user that we want their name they would enter their name and the results of whatever they entered would be stored in the variable username where i could use it for other purposes okay so let's go ahead and take this new input function and use it in our cell system fahrenheit program so i'm going to go ahead and ask the user to input the temperature in celsius um and so you'll notice i've got two lines here uh why do i have two lines well the thing is that that input function is is designed to return string data types so if the user enters in 30 i'm not going to get the number 30 i'm actually going to get the string consisting of a 3 followed by a 0 and i can't use strings directly to enter into mathematical formulas so i need to convert the string three zero into the number three zero and so that's what the second line here does float is going to take uh something inside the parentheses there it's what we refer to as a parameter it's going to take its parameter and convert it to a floating point number so in this case it will take whatever the user entered whatever string the user entered in as the input and it will convert it to an actual number and it will store that value into the celsius variable and if we want we can actually get rid of the the intermediate variable here temp i can put this all in one line i can say celsius equals request the user enter the temperature in celsius so the user will enter the temperature in celsius and that will be returned that result that the user has returned for example the string 3 0 will immediately be passed into float and float will convert it to from the string quote 3 0 to the number 3 0 where we can use in our mathematical formula and so here's our program so i'm going to go ahead and ask the user to enter the temperature in celsius i'm going to convert to floating point number i'm going to store that in the variable or storage location called celsius and i'm going to retrieve the storage location celsius i'm going to multiply it by 9 divided by 5 and add 32 to it i'm going to store that result in fahrenheit and i'm going to go ahead and print temperature in fahrenheit is and then uh whatever the results in the variable fahrenheit is now if you look at the handout i've actually taken a further step out of this um and so you could get rid of the variable here fahrenheit and just put the celsius times 9 divided by 5 plus 32 right there into the print statement and we could even take it a step further and we could put this all in one line i could say print temperature and fahrenheit is and then float input enter temperature in celsius times 9 divided by 5 plus 32 i haven't done that and actually one of the reasons why this version is slightly longer than the version in the handout is because the font used for these videos is much larger and it didn't really fit very nicely in one line in the video so you know in general i do recommend that you break it down into smaller size steps it's easier to read and it's harder to make mistakes if you cram this all into one line it is technically possible to write this entire program in a single line of code but it's going to be hard for people to figure out what you're doing and it's going to be super easy for you to accidentally make a mistake and it's going to be a little bit hard for you to track down your error so i don't really recommend that okay so uh let's go ahead and run this program a bunch of times and you can see uh each of the times it's asking us please enter the temperature in celsius so up at the top i said it was 30 degrees and it said oh great that means the temperature in fahrenheit is 86. and i re-ran it and said enter the temperature celsius i set it to 20 degrees said okay great that temperature is 68 in fahrenheit you know if the temp heaven forbid the temperature at celsius is zero that means the temperature in fahrenheit is 32 and so on so um we've created our first program and you can see that it's once we've written it it's super easy to use and it's much easier than retyping that formula over and over and over again and of course if the formula were much more extensive it would save us even more time so this is something that computers are really great at and it actually turns out python is pretty extensively used across campus in scientific labs and in fact different departments like for example the chemistry department the biology department have have sort of emphasized to the computer science department that they would really like us to teach python and that's one of the reasons why we switch cs106a over to python all right so that is our first python program um next lecture we'll be extending our programming capabilities to do more interesting things but i think that's enough for today and this gives you an idea of what programming looks like and how programming languages work i'll talk to you soon
