welcome to exploring computing today's video is creating web pages adding images so this is going to be part of a continuing series where we take a look at how to add different elements to our web pages previously we saw how to create links between our web pages and that's certainly critical because as we've talked about the thing that really makes the web the web is that hypertext and so if you've watched those videos you now know how to do that but while those links are great our if all our web pages have on them as text that's going to be pretty boring so in this video we're going to talk about how to add images to our web pages it turns out that there's a fair number of options and some subtleties here which may not be obvious so we're going to go through the different options and how to get everything to fit together i'm going to start off with this image from venice that you've seen previously from the first week and this is mostly going to be our example image although there are a couple images we'll see along the way okay so here's how you're going to add the image to your web page there's an img tag notice that the closing slash at the end of the img tag indicates this is a standalone tag there is no start and end tag and there's an src property or source property this is a url and it can be a relative or an absolute reference i'm using a relative reference which you'll recall from our discussion on links means that this venis.jpg image file is in the same location as the html file that is referring to it and then you're supposed to have an alt tag alt tag is information used for a variety of different purposes most notably to increase accessibility by those who may not be able to see your web page and are using screen readers which read the web page to them instead of viewing the web page it is required if you do not have an alt tag you will have an illegal html file okay so just using the img tag as shown here this will put the image on the web page but the next question is how does this image relate to the text around it and this is where things get a little bit messy so what i've done here is i've added some extra text here so this img tag and the text that is all um in my html source file uh as far as the lorem ipsum goes here this is randomized text from cicero's on the ends of good and evil and it's commonly used as placeholder text for design work so you'll see this in a fair number of places if you start trying to learn how to do design and so we're just going to go ahead with this traditional traditional random text okay let's take a closer look at our web page here if you look down in our zoomed in view here and look at the relationship between the image and the text you'll see that the text comes down not below the image but actually alongside the image so this looks a little bit odd and i think the way i like describing it is it's as if the image were a giant letter so like let's say you wanted to have a giant l there this is what the image is doing so we're going to use the letter o and uh here's a diagram where i created a giant o and you've all probably seen those fairy tales where they've got once upon a time and that o is really big and so here's my big o here and then if i go ahead and have that img tag followed by the once upon a time you can see that this image acts as a gigantic o so as i suggested it's like the image acts as a gigantic character and just to emphasize that this is not something that just occurs at the beginning of the line here i've used my image in two places and you can see that each time my image has ended up looking like a gigantic o in the middle of our line of text so this is probably not what you want so let's go back to our venice image here and we're going to try and correct this there's a couple different options i think one of the more interesting ones that you are likely to need if you've got a web page of any complexity is something called float okay so let's go let's go back to our uh image event here i'm going to start using some style rules for how to control how venice or venice images appearing on the web page the first thing i need to do though in order to get this to work is i need to add an id to venice so let's go ahead and do that i could also use a class i suppose i could write a rule that applied to all image tags remember we have those type selectors so i could write a type selector that applied to all images but that may not be the best option uh we'll have a separate video where i go over an extensive example and we can talk about these different options for now i'm just going to go ahead and give my img tag an id i'm also going to increase the number of paragraphs of ipsom lures just so we've got a little bit more interesting text to work with all right so i'm going to go ahead and add a star rule for the venice id here so remember that's the number sign venice to use an id selector whereas it were a class selector i would use a dot and then i'm going to use this new style property we haven't seen before called float and as you can see here float floats the image to the left side of the web page and the text flows alongside of it it's quite different than what we saw before a minute ago where the image was acting as a gigantic character now it's clearly an image floated to the left side of our web page and so as i mentioned a little earlier this is a great technique that you can use on a lot of different web pages and then of course there's a float right that moves the image to the right so one issue that comes up is where does the image actually appear and what you need to do here is you need to list the image before the text you want to flow alongside of it previously i listed the image first followed by the paragraphs and that put the image alongside the very first paragraph again the first paragraph was listed below the image in the actual html source now i'm going to move the paragraphs so i have the first paragraph before the image and then the second paragraph after the image tag and so you can see that i've done that here and when we look at the result you can see that sure enough the image floats alongside the second paragraph because the image appears before the second paragraph so remember image needs to be listed before the text it's going to float alongside and then we can actually stick the image in the middle of the paragraph as well and so here that's what i've done here you can see i've got the paragraph and i've sort of highlighted where the paragraph starts and ends and um let's take a look at that word there i have no idea how to pronounce latin but i'm going to claim it looks it says dewis that appears immediately after the img tag and if we look at our image you can see that sure enough that word appears roughly after the start of the image so basically the web browser is trying to get it as close as possible to the image without having a huge massive blank space there so you can kind of play around with it but it it it does seem like um i know many students find this behavior a little bit odd just remember you want to have that img tag before whatever you want alongside of the image all right let's go ahead and take this back to our first example where we did the float left now if we're looking at the float left here and we look at what the web page actually looks like you'll notice that there's an awful lot of crowding between the photo and those words alarm ipsum that clearly does not look right we really want some space there and we can go ahead and do that by adding a margin so here i've added a margin of 15 pixels and this actually gives us space on the right where we were really noticing we have a problem it's a little hard to see but there's also space on the left side of the photo and on the top and the bottom of the photo so when we say margin 15 pixels we're saying put a margin around the entire image on the top bottom left and right we can control this individually as well if we want so i'm going to go ahead and set the margin on the right to 30 pixels i'm getting rid of the overall margin so my 15 pixels on the top bottom and left are gone it's a little harder to tell that the top and bottom are gone i think if you look closely you can kind of tell that the 15 pixels is gone on the left there is a little bit of slight space still left there by the web browser um and so the basic point here is i can control each of the four margins individually notice that the way it works is margin dash followed by the specific margin as opposed to left margin right margin it's margin right margin left margin top margin bottom okay it turns out that margins are just one of several different properties related to what are called box properties box properties allow me to put boxes around elements and so the box properties are the margin the border which we'll take a look at in a minute and then the padding these work not only on images but on any block level element so if you want to put a margin a border and a padding around a paragraph you totally can do that and in fact this can give you some nice effects so for example if you've got a block quote and you want to float that and put a margin around it that is totally doable all right so let's take a close look at our border our padding and our margin in this example i've set border padding and margin i've set a 10 pixel solid blue border a 10 pixel padding and a 20 pixel margin and okay the border is pretty obvious although it's going to turn out there's a bunch of subtleties to that what's the padding the padding is the space between the image or whatever element that you're using the box properties on between the image and the border and then the margin is the space between the border and whatever surrounds the image all right let's take a closer look at the border as i mentioned this this has a little bit of subtleties to it okay i've combined three different properties here into a single line but we can actually separate border 10 pixel solid blue into three individual properties border widths 10 pixels border style solid border color blue order width and border color are pretty obvious um the solid you can sort of work that out like that's a solid border okay sure um so there's actually a whole bunch of settings for border styles let me just really briefly mention too you can have a dashed line you can have a dotted line mostly what i want to emphasize here though is you need to have a border style oddly the default border style is none so if you say hey i want a border that's 10 pixels in blue the web browser is going to be like i'm sorry that's great you want that i'm not displaying a border because the default border style is none so you have a non-existent 10 pixel blue border have fun with it so remember to have that border style solid or the fancier options like dashed or dotted whatever but you do need to have a border style if you just provide a color and a width you will get nothing it's super annoying all right let's look at our other options here so i've been floating the image that works great for a lot of purposes but maybe you don't want that maybe you want the image to show up by itself with paragraphs above and below it well the first thing to remember is let's go back to our original attempt to just stick an image onto our web page before we did the float okay remember this is what we got we're treated as a giant character okay that's not what we want um one possible solution here is one of the issues why this is being treated as giant character characters because the text following the image is not in a block tag so if we go ahead and put our paragraphs into paragraph block tags then we can go ahead and get this effect here i've got a paragraph before the image i've got a paragraph after the image the paragraphs are explicitly blocks and then between the two blocks i get the image and this seems to be what i want but there are a couple problems but before i move off of that notice i've gotten rid of the style here and i've got that slash asterisk no style use slash asterisk what the heck is that well obviously part one i'm trying to tell you yeah i'm not forgetting the style sheet there is a style sheet there and there is no style used but the question is like what is this star stuff this is what it's referred to as a comment this will show up in html it will show up in our style sheets and in particular will show up in our coding when we're actually coding you will often want to put a comment there that's only readable by a human and is not actually processed by the computer so this slash star no style used that is strictly for you as a human being as far as if this were actually a cascading style sheet the computer would be like eh i'm not paying attention to that that's for a human i'm not a human i'm a computer all right so i've got the paragraph before i've got the img tag i've got the paragraph after and as we can see on our screenshot on the left this seems to work right well there's kind of a problem here it turns out that if you just put the image by itself like this you're going to lose some of your options most notably the main thing that you would want to do with this image is you might want to center it and it turns out if the img tag is by itself it cannot be centered so what you need to do is you actually need to put a div around the image so here i've added a div i've given the different id venice div and let's go ahead and add a style to it i've added this style text align center and now the image is aligned to the center remember if you try and horizontally align the image by itself it's not going to work it's going to turn out we can vertically align the image i'll show you that in a second but we cannot horizontally align the image this is a limitation because it turns out the img tag itself is not a block level tag and the horizontal alignment only works with block level tags all right let's take a look at the vertical alignment now let's go back to where i had that giant character once upon a time so here it is right here this is what we saw last time i'm going to go ahead and give it an id because i want to be able to give it a style rule and i've written a style rule for it and previously the base of the o basically gigantic o was aligned with the baseline of the text that's sort of the default setting and now i've told it to vertically align with the middle and you can see that i am in fact aligned in the middle there's also a top and a bottom vertical alignment you can play with so that gives you an idea of what all your options are for images so go out and make web pages with lots of colorful fun images i'll see in the next video
