welcome to exploring computing today's video is web page example history blog so in our last example we saw the use of class in a number of places we saw that we created a class for captions and a class for photographs and a separate class for write photographs versus love photographs and this idea of taking divs or other elements we've been giving and providing them with classes can be quite powerful one of the places that this often shows up is in blogs so here i've got a blog about stanford history and you can see i've done some formatting on it and in fact you're going to get a chance to do some formatting on this for your next homework assignment so we will be providing you with the html for this file but not the css so we do want you to create css from scratch but let's go over the css that i used in order to get the current look that we're looking at right here all right so if we think about how this blog works there's a number of different elements on the blog so there's a bunch of entries in the blog and each of the entries has a heading with the title and then there's some dates and i don't have a footer shown here but we'll see that in the source there's actually a footer and then the number of tags that you can display for each of the entries on the blog and so these are all different elements that commonly show up in blogs now if you look at the source of a blog often you'll see that what they've done is they've taken a number of these items and some of them might be paragraphs some of them might be divs some of them might actually be headings and they will go ahead and give them classes so this is what my source code looks like for each of the entries in the blog and you can see i've given a class for the entries class for the heading which has a title and the date in it a class for the content a class for the footers and a class for the tags that go on the footers you as i mentioned in the end of the caption example there are some new html5 elements that don't actually provide any formatting on their own uh but may be used to provide a bit of semantic information so the example that was relevant for that particular example was there's a figure and a figure caption um entry and so you could replace the class equals entry here with the article html5 element but when i went to look at a number of blogs that are actually on the web i didn't see any of them using those techniques now it could be that these are just older blogs and that's why they're using the techniques i'm showing you here or it could be that modern blogging software has not been updated to use those elements but regardless the blogs that i looked at look pretty close to what we're seeing here so we're going to go ahead and continue using this okay so what i'm going to do here is we're going to go through and we're going to take a look at some examples of how i did formatting with this blog and so again i think the things to keep in mind are one this idea that we have a bunch of divs and in one case we actually have an h2 if you look carefully the heading there actually does have an h2 there we have a bunch of divs and the h2 and we are classifying them by putting a class attribute value pair on them as i said this shows up all the time and then two as we go through the formatting that i did on each of these um we'll see various different formatting features that i will point out to you that may be useful for your own work so let's start off with the entry title um and so you can see this is uh this is the leland stanford purchases lan or the university established or the earthquake dev states campus these are my h2s and you can see that i have the h2 but i've also given the class entry title and so i'm going to go ahead and write a rule to apply to the entry titles i suppose i could also use it for h2s assuming there aren't other h2s on the web page um you can imagine maybe i have a sidebar that has an h2 or maybe some advertisements that use h2 but i've gone ahead and chose to use the entry title uh class selector rather than the h2 selector you see i'm given a font size a font weight now i think i mentioned earlier that there are actually font weights can go between 100 and 900 you could also set font weight to bold um i've set a color and then i think the interesting one for this entry that we haven't talked about is this font family here notice i've actually listed three font families times new roman times and then serif if you list a number of different font families what will happen is the web browser will look for each of these font families and as soon as it finds one that matches it will go ahead and use that so there's a font that you're not sure is going to be on the person's computer you can go ahead and list several fonts um and you know going from the order of the hey i really hope they have this font installed but if they don't let's try this font and if they don't have that one let's try this font and then you can end up with either serif or sans serif which are two of the primary choices in terms of design and we'll talk about those more in the design web design lecture anyway the main point i wanted to mention here is just this idea that you can list several fonts for the font family and it will go with whichever one it finds first in the list okay here's how i set up the entry dates um if you look in the image on the right i know it's a little bit small there but you can see the dates are on the far right and they are alongside the actual blog entries and how did i did that i did that by using float so i floated the entry dates to the right um i didn't have to set a width on this i know in the caption example i talked about how you should be careful about to set widths on text uh when you're floating it however in this case since the dates are actually years and they can never be more than four characters that wasn't that wasn't an issue you are going to want to set a width on floating elements if they are text and if they are potentially long because as you may recall from our discussion with the captions on the images if you have a really long caption and you don't put a width on it it will expand out to take as much of the web page as it can including the entire web page if it's a long enough caption you can limit that by putting a width on it here i'm not limiting it again just because i know that they're only four characters long okay for each of the entries i have you can see i have those red lines running across above and below each entry uh how did i do that well here i put a top border which is two pixels solid red and in addition i put a little bit of extra padding and margin above each element um you'll notice that the padding in the margin actually lists four different values what is up with that well here's how that works if you go ahead and set a single value it is the padding or margin for uh for all four directions if you set two of them you're setting a top and bottom and then a left and a right and if you set all four it starts in the top goes to the right goes to the bottom goes to left so in this case i could have said padding top and margin top but i thought it'd be more interesting to switch things up so you could see this other technique now one of the issues that comes up is this particular rule is putting a red line above each of the entries because i have the border top set to two pixels but i'm not actually setting a bottom border so how am i going to get the bottom border there are several ways to do this i think the most common technique is to add a class to the last item and you can see here's the last entry here i've added this class last on to it and then i've written a rule that applies to just items that have class last and so i've given the last item a border bottom of two pixels solid red and so all the entries have a top border and the last entry has a bottom border and so that's how i get those four lines the three on top and then the fourth line below all the elements but there are other ways of doing this so um if you want to get fancy we talked about this briefly i mentioned this briefly when we were talking about pseudo classes that there are these last pseudo classes so there's a last child and a last of type and so here's the last child and so you can see all my entries actually fit in this div called main and so if i write a rule that applies to the last child in main that will apply to that bottom div i could also write a last of type rule and so here i'm saying i want this to apply to an entry uh but i only wanted to apply to the last of that type so the last thing with an entry class and you can see that um i can go ahead and use that to to put a bottom border on just the last of my entries okay so originally i did not have a footer but when i decided to turn this into homework assignment for all of you i wanted to have a little bit more interesting stuff for you guys to play around with so i added a footer but i wasn't really quite sure what to do with the footer so i kind of cheated so i thought i'd show you this little technique that i used to cheat and that is you can actually make items disappear there's two different techniques to make it disappear this one is the display none and so what this does is this just completely removes that element so you can see here i've got an entry footer here if you look at the bottom of my html section here you can see that there's a div class entry footer and that there's a bunch of entry tags for this particular item and i decided i didn't want any of them to show up by the way you guys don't get to do this for your homework do something interesting with the footers and the tags okay so uh by setting display to none it just completely disappears as if it did not exist the other way to make something invisible is to set visibility to hidden this actually does something a little bit different than saying display none though if you set the visibility to hidden what happens is the space where that element would have been if it had been placed normally will still be there the item just will not be shown on that space so if we were to do this you'd actually see some blank spaces for those entry footer divs down at the bottom of each of these entries so you'd see a little bit of extra space uh where these circles are i didn't actually do visibility hidden so the image you see on the top right is actually with display none just as the other images in this series have i've shown that but you can play with these two settings display none or visibility hidden okay um also we did this with the caption example but i thought i just mentioned it really briefly i did surround the entire thing with the div i gave it the id all and then i used the auto on the left to the right margin that's how i went ahead and centered everything okay so this idea of taking a bunch of elements and adding a class to it that actually turns out to be pretty powerful and so the idea here is html does not necessarily have tags for everything we think might be potentially interesting and so if there isn't a tag available a specific tag available we can go ahead and sort of add one of our own by using a div or one of the other tags and actually giving it a class and so there's there's a group that's really gone and run with this sort of idea and that's the micro formats organization and um so we're going to take a look at two micro formats the first one we're going to take a look at has to do with reviews so suppose i was looking at uh you know thinking about going to the movies sadly can't do that right now um and i heard this avengers end game movie was out and i wanted to know hey is avengers end game any good and so i could go ahead google it and by google avengers end game review you can see that some of the reviews actually have these stars in uh google so google somehow knows that those are reviews and that they've given them a certain number of stars and it's able to display those stars uh in the search results how does it know that it's a review and that um the reviewer gave a certain number of stars well um google supports a micro format called h review and so here's the h review what the h review format looks like and this is an example from the microformats.org website and if you look at this you'll see that throughout the html here there's a whole bunch of classes i'm just going to focus on two of them up here at the top there's a class h review that google can look at and say oh this does follow the age review format and then there's a class rating and by google looking for that class rating and seeing the number there that's actually how it can determine how many stars to put in the summary another micro format that shows up fairly frequently is the v card or h card uh format and this is for virtual business cards and so the idea here is um you know people often have business cards that they can to people so people can get information like their contact information and so the idea behind the h card or v card is that you can put that sort of information on your website but um it's not enough to just put the information on your website if you want people to be able to pull that information off and store it in a separate program however if you were to put that information on your website notify people that you are using this specific technique in this case the vcard technique tools that are designed to work with vcards can search through the html tags looking for specific entries with specific classes so you can see here i can see that there's a class street address there's certainly no html tag for street address but by putting class equals street address on it i'm letting any tool that's designed to work with these vcards no that's my street address it can go ahead and pull the information out of that tag 169 university avenue can go ahead and stuff it into the the virtual business card database similarly there's a postal code there's a telephone number there's an email address these are all things that don't have html tags associated with them there we will discover later there is an email for a form entry where people can type in email but in general things like the postal code the country name cell phone number and presenting the email as opposed to entering the email into a form these do not have html tags but by putting classes on them i am able to provide classification information that a program designed to read web pages can go ahead and pick that information out and go ahead and process it so again i just wanted to emphasize this idea that putting classes on elements can can be used for quite a number of different purposes all right that's it for this example
