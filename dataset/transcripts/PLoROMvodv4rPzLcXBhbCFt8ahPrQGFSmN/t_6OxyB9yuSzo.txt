welcome to exploring computing today's video is creating web pages specifying colors so if you haven't already watched the hexadecimal numbers video watch that first hexadecimal numbers are critical to working with colors on web pages for cs 105 students that video is in the same folder as this video for cs106e students we covered hex decimal numbers last week in the lo6 memory lecture series also as a reminder of how the computer actually generates colors it mixes the amount of red green and blue on each of the sub pixels composing each of the individual pixels in the screen so remember when we're specifying colors we're specifying the intensity of red green and blue we learned that the first week in the lecture on images okay so let's start off with a little history lesson this will tie back in once upon a time we had only 16 named colors and here they are so we'll see in a minute you guys have it much better off but there was another big problem that we had which was that the computer monitors only display 256 colors and it turns out that the computer manufacturers could not agree on what those 256 colors were so there were only 211 colors that were agreed upon by all the computer manufacturers and these were referred to as the web safe colors so if you see the term web safe color that's what they're referring to it should not be an issue any longer because any modern computer display or mobile device should display 16.7 million colors or more i don't think you're going to run into devices that only have 256 colors but you will run into the term web safe color that is what it's referring to okay what do we have now well as far as named colors go there are 148 named colors and as we've talked about previously there are 16.7 million colors as you learned about in the first week how computer store and display images and in addition to having 16.7 million colors we also have 256 levels of transparency in computer science we usually refer to this as alpha but it corresponds to either transparency or its opposite opacity the name colors are what are sometimes referred to as the css3 that's cascading style sheet three there are several versions of cascading style sheets they're starting to work on cascading style sheets for but they haven't really finished cascading style sheets 3 yet the cascading style sheet 3 had an extended color standard and these are referred to as the css3 extended color keywords or the svg that scalar vector graphics which we talked about briefly in our lecture on image representation that's the object version of storing image information that is available on the web we may talk about that again in more detail another lecture it's also referred to as the svg 1.0 color keyword names these are sometimes also referred to as html5 colors although that is not technically correct you may also hear them refer to just css colors i'm not going to list all 148 of them but this kind of gives you a feel for what sort of options you have available there are quite a few options there's a lot going on there but they are nowhere near the full color palette remember we can represent 16.7 million colors and the extended color keywords only give us 148. so i think they're they're fun if nothing else and they may give you some ideas on colors to play with but they are not they're they're fairly limited now when we're looking at these sample lists here we've got the name that's pretty obvious what that is and then we have the representation of the color and it's pretty obvious what that is and then what is between those two that thing that starts with a number sign well if you've watched the hexadecimal video you will know that that is the hexadecimal color specification and if you haven't watched the hexadecimal video yet watch the hexadecimal video all right so as we saw in the hexadecimal video and as you recall from our discussion on uh computer displays and images from the first week computers used 24-bit color or 32-bit color and in either one of these two schemes colors are represented by mixing red green and blue light and red corresponds to a single byte green corresponds to single byte and blue corresponds to single byte that gives us decimal numbers between 0 and 255 but it gives us hexadecimal numbers between 0 0 and ff and for the web they're traditionally represented as hex decimal numbers and so here we've got cardinal red and it would be represented by the sequence eight c one five one five so six hexadecimal digits two hexadecimal digits for red two hexadecimal digits for green two hexadecimal digits for blue and as you'll recall from the hexadecimal discussion each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four bits so two hexadecimal digits corresponds to eight bits which is a byte so that's where we get our successes and decimal digits 24 bit color i think the most important thing to understand as far as hexadecimal goes when we're working with html and web pages and cascading style sheets and colors is how to make adjustments so here i've got a crimson red and we're using crimson red although we saw cardinal red a moment ago because cardinal red is perfect we don't want to modify cardinal red but we might want to play with our crimson red so this is crimson red dc143c and so when you look at this color you might think i think there's a little bit too much red so what you want to do is you want to be able to look at this and say well that first pair of hexadecimal digits that dc that's the amount of red and so i can move the amount of red up or down so like if i wanted to move it up if i wanted to move it up slightly you know what it comes above dc well dd comes above dc and then d e and then df and then e0 right or we can go in the other direction and say okay dc's too much let me reduce it very slightly db um da d9 d8 and so be able to move up and down now you're probably not going to be moving up by increments of one that's that's really but maybe your eyesight and artistic abilities are such that you might notice the difference i'm not going to be able to know it's different so i would move it up much more or move it down much more so here i've moved it down to ac and you can see that this is a considerably darker red than we started off with um so you know again say we wanted to uh adjust the amount of blue maybe one we want a little bit more blue so i could i remember okay ac that's now our red 1-4 that's our green and three c is our blue and so if i want to move blue up 3c what comes after 3c e 3 f 4 0 or if i want to go down from 3 c 3 b 3 a 3 9 and so on again those are minor adjustments i'm going to make a much bigger adjustment here i'm going to take the 3c and just boost up to 5c and you can see the results here so basically you want to be able to take these color specifications and have a good enough understanding of hexadecimal to be able to make adjustments up or down so focus on understanding how to increase and decrease the hexadecimal numbers rather than worrying about how to convert to decimal now if you look at this little overlay that i've got here you may notice that you can kind of see the color squares behind it and so this is an example of using alpha to alpha controls again either the opacity or the transparency the two are basically opposites opacity says how much are we preventing the light from coming through and transparency says how much are we allowing the light to come through so in addition to being able to specify the amount of red green and blue we have we can also add in fourth pair of hexadecimal digits to control the alpha so here eight c one five one five that's our crimson red but um that's actually clover of eight c one five one five that's rgb and then ff that is the uh that last set of hexadecimal digits is the alpha and with ff that's the maximum that we're allowed to specify and so this is full opacity this means we cannot see through this at all and so you can see the example overlay title and then a crimson background using the color i've specified here and you cannot see through that uh crimson at all so we're going to reduce it slightly here's 75 i've gone from ff to bf and if you look at the example overlay over our image of vanish you can see you're starting to be able to see venice through the crimson background there and that's because it's not at full opacity it's now at only 75 opacity we can lower it even more this is a about 50 opacity um i specified that last pair of uh that fourth pair of hexadecimal digits again representing the opacity i've cut it down from ff all the way down to eight zeros this is basically halfway you can see you can see a lot more of the background showing through so that kind of gives you an idea of how to play around with the alpha if you want to do that you can also use three or four digit colors instead of instead of using six or eight digit colors and so what happens here is we take uh let's start for the three digit example we take our original rgb and we just get rid of you know have the number of uh letters so as long as our pairs are you know both the tens well they're not really tens i suppose they're sixteens as long as the sixteens and the ones are the same if we were using decimal it would be the tens and the ones we can immediately convert it to three hexadecimal digits and i've written these down as they're equal that's not really true it's more the ffff is transformed into fff uh they're not you know if we were to do the actual conversion in base 16 these of course are not equal but as far as how they're specified um in this three three digit scheme uh for colors that's the way it works so similarly cc 9900 can just be written as c90 and one one aa33 could be written as 1a3 if you work this out what ends up happening here is we're losing the number of colors we can specify with our original 8 hexadecimal digit scheme remember that corresponds to 24 bits and so 2 to the 24 gives us 16.7 million colors with the three hexadecimal digit scheme we've only got 12 bits as that gives us 2 to the 12th which means we have 4096 colors so basically you're losing the ability to specify a lot of colors but you know unless you're fine-tuning things you may not notice it it just really depends on what you're doing and you can also specify these with four hexadecimal digits where the fourth hexadecimal digit corresponds to the amount of alpha so how do we take these specifications and actually use them on a web page so here's a short little example showing how i used some colors so i've created a style sheet i'm specifying a style rule for the body and you can see i'm providing the color and background color properties and for color i'm just using one of those predefined color names wheat and then for the background color i'm using my hexadecimal specifications take the specifications we've been showing you here and slap them in the style sheet anywhere at color is expected now if you are hexadecimally challenged it is possible to do it without the hexadecimals traditionally it is done by hexadecimals and the hexadecimal colors are going to show up in a lot of places so you know i do think that you should try and get at least some familiarity with them you should be familiar enough with them that when you see them you're like oh that's a color and i can kind of get a sense by looking at the r the g and the b at more or less what it might look like but if you really don't want to specify the amounts in hexadecimal you can specify them either as percentages or as just straight decimal numbers so this is going to be instead of specifying the number as number sign hexadecimal pair hexadecimal pair hexadecimal pair you can specify it use vibrating rgb and then giving a set of percentages for red green and blue or you can give numbers between 000 and 255. this also works for alpha you specify alpha as a percentage and then finally we'll talk about this later in the quarter when we're talking about uh website design but depending on what you're doing you may want to specify instead of rgb you could specify using hue saturation and lightness this will be useful when you're trying to choose color schemes um and again we will talk about this later and here's what this looks like on an actual web page uh inside this style sheet all right so this is kind of giving me a sense of how colors are specified on web pages and now between the images we talked about earlier and the colors we specified here you should be able to make much more interesting and fun web pages i'll talk to you soon
