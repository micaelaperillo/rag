welcome to exploring computing today's video is introduction to html grammar and vocabulary in human and computer languages so at this point you know that html stands for hypertext markup language and we spent some time talking about what hypertext is and we've spent some time talking about market what about languages now of course we all have an intuitive idea of what language is but like what is the relationship between a computer language and a human language is it the same thing and so that's what we're going to talk about now we're also going to learn some new grammar rules for html so stay tuned for that okay so both computer languages and human languages are the same and that they're both used for communication but of course one of them we're communicating with a human and the other one we're communicating with the computer so how does that play out well when we're learning a new human language there's two different things that we need to learn we need to learn what the grammar rules are for that language and we need to learn vocabulary for the language and the same thing's going to happen in computer languages we refer to the grammar rules as syntax and we think about vocabulary as being similar to the computer science concept of semantics and for human languages vocabulary is arguably the more important of the two so you know if i'm stuck out somewhere and i don't speak spanish and i say banyo donde people will figure out what i'm trying to say or if i'm somewhere in japan and i say toire dokko you know my grammar may be off but people will figure out what i'm trying to say and if they want to be helpful they'll point to where i need to go now unfortunately for computer languages the grammar must be perfect that's less true for html where you can kind of get away with some stuff for the cascading style sheets which are going to be teaching you next lecture your grammar needs to be close to perfect and when we get to programming languages your grammar absolutely has to be perfect you can kind of think of it as some countries or some regions have a reputation where if your grammar isn't perfect even though everybody knows you're looking for the bathroom they're still going to say well i'm going to ignore you because your grammar's not perfect well that's what the computer is like computer will be like i know you're looking for the bathroom because i totally understand what you're saying but like your grammar's wrong and so i'm just gonna sit here and not do anything that's what the computer is gonna do okay there is some good news when learning computer languages versus human languages and that is the grammar is actually pretty simplified for computer languages compared to human languages which can have some pretty squirrely rules and the vocabulary is also much more limited how limited well it turns out for html there are fewer than 120 html elements and some of those are pretty specialized so here's some examples of some elements which most of you will never ever need to know about so the bdi and bdo elements are used to reverse text directions so this is important when you're working with certain languages and particularly if you have a web page that has languages that go left to right and then you have quotes from languages that go right to left but like how far are you going to make those web pages so you know if you're a language specialist you might need these tags but the rest of us are like no we don't need to know about these tags or elements wbr i didn't even know this existed so i went on the web page to count out how many tags there are actually in active use uh this is used to determine where to break a word so like let's say you have a really long word like supercalifragilist be expialidocious and you're trying to tell the computer if this does not fit all in a single line where should i put the line breaks well that's what the wbr is for yeah i've never used it and then track this is used to indicate subtitles for audio you might use it but like i've never actually put audio on a webpage before um so you know depending upon what you're planning to do with your web pages yeah it might actually be quite useful but for most of us not so much so there's a bunch of these that aren't very important and then there's a bunch of them that are super obvious so like the p for paragraph okay that's pretty obvious article that's used to create an article like for example if you've got a bunch of articles in your blog section that's used to create a section so some of them are totally straightforward and some of them aren't used at all so it turns out there are 120 that's a moderate amount but it's not a huge amount and a lot of them are super easy or not going to be used so the total vocabulary for html is actually pretty small okay and we've learned some grammar rules for html and again in computer science we refer to these as syntax rules so for example we learned that html uses tags that the tags were compared with start text and tags that the tags indicate elements so remembered element is basically the start tag the end tag and the contents we learned that there's different rules for combining tags and that tags must be fully nested so that italic tag must be completely contained in the bold tag or the bold tag must be completely contained in the italic tag we can't sort of mix the two but what about some more grammar rules or more syntax rules um are there rules for how the elements can be nested like which elements can go inside which so we said the italic can go inside the bowl the bowl can go inside the italic what if i want to combine an h1 remember that's the largest size header with an italic are there rules for how that works and the answer is yes unfortunately as of html5 they've gotten more complex the html4 rules are much simpler so i'm going to start off by talking a little bit about how the html4 rules are and you can kind of think of this as a good rule of thumb and a good way of thinking about things so maybe sort of the equivalent of the english i before e except after c which is a rule that people learning english sometimes here and it mostly works except for when it doesn't and so this is a good way of thinking about things and mostly this will lead you in the correct direction okay so in general there's two main types of tags there are what are referred to as text level tags these are sometimes referred as inline tags and these are tags used to indicate information about a word or a couple of words within a larger say paragraph so the bold tag and the italic tag are examples of this so there's also this subscript tag and the superscript tag which you might use if if you're creating a document about math but you know many of you won't use those but anyway so there's a bunch of these tags that are designed to take a couple words a couple letters and do something with them those are called text level or inline tags and then the other block level tags the block level text as the name sort of suggests are used to create blocks of text so this would be like the h1 remember that's our largest size header the h2s h3s all the headers the paragraph tag and other tags um we'll see there's like table tags create tables there are tags create lists of items these are all block level tags there are also a set of tags that as far as i know don't have an official name but i think of as structural tags and those are tags like the html tag the head tag and the body tag and we're not going to worry about those for this discussion all right so between the text level and the block level tags so if i've got a bunch of text and in the midst of that text i have a bunch of text level tags for example maybe i've got some bold tags and some metallic tags mixed in i refer to that as phrasing if i've got a bunch of text and i've got block level tags as well as inline tags in there i refer to that as flow and so what we've got is we've got certain tags we're allowed to place phrasing in meaning i can put text and text level tags or other elements i can put flow in so if something's indicated as this can only contain phrasing that means it can't contain block level tags so you can have a bold tag and a tag in there but you can't have a paragraph in there if something can contain phrasing that means you can have the bold tag and the tag tag in there you can also have paragraph tags you can have table tags basically you can have any of the tags that actually create content on the web page that doesn't mean you could have an html tag in there or a head tag and they're a body tag those those don't count but you can have any of the content tags like the bold tag the italic tag the paragraph tag the headings the h1 through h6 tags table tags that all counts as flow okay so block all block table level tags may contain phrasing so like if you've got a paragraph you could totally have bold tags in italic text and that's totally fine text level tags may not contain bulb level tags so you've got italics element it cannot contain a paragraph element we've got a bold tag that bold element it's defining cannot contain a paragraph in it that's illegal some block level tags may contain flow so here i've got the article tag as i mentioned earlier article is used to indicate um it's going to be used on a web page that maybe has a bunch of different articles so an example this would be if i've got a blog and i've got a bunch of entries for my blog on the same page i could mark each of those entries as articles and then i could contain flow meaning within those articles i could have a bunch of headings h1 through h6 i could have tables i could have paragraphs you know i could put basically anything within the article so article is an example of a block level tag that can contain flow some block level tags can't contain flow they can only contain phrasing and so example this would be an h1 tag so remember h1 is used to create a heading to indicate a heading on the web page um if i got an h1 that's my largest size heading it doesn't make sense to say oh you know okay so a normal use of the heading would be like h1 stanford history so that indicates i should have a large heading on the top of my web page that says stanford history does it make sense to say h1 um hey i've got three paragraphs in my heading and i've got a table in my heading and you know i've got a block quote in my heading that that makes no sense at all so the h1 is an example of a block level tag that can contain phrasing meaning i can have text and text level tags so i could have stanford and then i have history where history is in italics that would totally be legal but again we can't contain other block level tags in it okay here's a more complex version basically the more complex version is look it up so i provided you with a handout appendix a from the cs105 course reader and um it doesn't have all the tags in it i think i've got uh i haven't counted up but i probably have about 40 of the 120 tags in there they're a good start and they're the ones that are most commonly used anyway so if if you look at that document you will see that it actually lists categories that a particular element fits in so we can see here that a paragraph counts as flow content so remember we said earlier there's phrasing and then there's flow and so a paragraph counts as flow and you can see that a paragraph can contain phrasing content so so far so good that matches our our little rule that we just told you so this is an example of the i before e except for after c english rule except for it actually works but we're about to see there's a bunch of times when it doesn't work okay this is new in html5 um and kind of unfortunate but basically html51 often defined a whole bunch of new category types and so you can see that the eight headings h1 through a6 they count as the flow content okay that's what we saw before but actually they have their very own category which is heading content so there's things like um there's an h group that can be used to create uh headings where you've got a major heading and then you've got a subheading so this would be sort of like if you have a title for your novel and then you have a subtitle that's what you would use the h group for and the h group can only contain heading content so it could contain h1 or a6 yeah it does allow us to have more interesting more complex stuff but it just sort of it just adds a lot of complexity here basically you now have to look everything up and you can see here i didn't quite fit on the slide here but uh you know article it counts as flow content but it also there's this new category called section content so there's no easy way to learn the new rules you're gonna have to look it up you can look up a lot of them in appendix a and then if you really get into it of course you can look in the official standard and see what the grammar rules there are um i did want to mention another thing related to our grammar roles and i am referring to them as grammar rules here and they are grammar rules but in computer science we usually refer to them as syntax rules so um get used to that name syntax rules particularly if you learn a programming language okay so here's another grammar syntax rule aware of angle quotes look at these two quotes that i have here so in the top chord i say hello everyone and in the bottom chord i have hello everyone but look at those quotation marks the bottom quotation marks are straight and the top quotation marks are angled so the left quotation mark and the right quotation mark are different here's the thing those are actually different unicode characters so um i'm showing unicode using the common designation which actually uses hexadecimal it's just one of five students you haven't seen this but you'll see this in a couple days uh so for now you just have to take my word for it but those are different codes those are different binary sequences so the binary sequence for the angle left code is different from the binary sequence for the right angle quote which is totally different from the binary sequence for the non-angle quote and only the non-angle quote is legal for syntax purposes for html so be super careful this um you'll also discover like if you copy and paste from things like pdf files weird things will happen because pdf can contain some different interesting characters there that perhaps the author did not originally create so just be aware of that so here you see i have two versions of my aahref um linking the word stanford to the stanford homepage notice that the top version has the non-angle quotes and the bottom version has the angle quotes the angle quotes version will not work at all and again these quotes will often get generated automatically by word processors and this is another reason why i strongly recommend you use a something that is a text editor when you're working with html that is specifically designed for programming use as opposed to something that maybe gets used for text editing but also has some features of word processors because those word processors documents will think oh i you know these these angle quotes look really cool i think that you'll i think you're really going to like these angle quotes it's gonna make your document look much nicer and then if you're actually typing html you're screwed so they do look cool though but don't use them bad things will happen okay so this seems like a lot of grammar to be remembering here's the bottom line validate everything we've mentioned this before run things through the validator the validator is going to tell you if there's something wrong if you've got those angled quotes instead of the non-angled quotes the validator is going to tell you if you're using some html element in a way that's actually illegal according to the html5 rules because you didn't look it up well the validator is going to tell you so definitely validate everything all right so next lecture we're going to take a look at cascading style sheets and we'll really be able to spice up our web pages and do all sorts of fun formatting once we've learned cascading style sheets i'll talk to you then you
