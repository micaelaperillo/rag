welcome to 69 machine learning some of you know that this closet or the Stanford for a long time and this is often the cost that I most look forward to teaching each year because this is where we've helped I think several generations of Stanford students become experts in machine learning golf built many of their products and services and startups that I'm sure many of you I pray all of you are using today so what I want to do today was spend some time talking over logistics and then spend some time you know giving you a beginning of an intro talk a little bit about machine learning so about 229 you know all of you have been reading about AI in the news about machine learning in the news and you pray heard me others say as a new electricity much as the rise of electricity about 100 years ago transformed every major industry I think AI already we call it machine learning but the rest of world seems to call it AI machine learning and an AI and deep learning will change the world and I hope that 3 2 3 9 will give you the tools you need so that you can be many of these future titans of industries that you can be one the gold and don't you know hope the large tech companies do the amazing things they do or both your own startup or going to some other industry go go transform healthcare or go transport transportation or go put a self-driving car and do all of these things that after this class I think you'll be able to do you know the majority of students applying the demand for AI skills the demand for machine learning skills is so vast I think you all know that and I think it's because machine learning has advanced so rapidly in the last few years that there are so many opportunities to apply learning algorithms right both in industry as well as in academia I think today we have the English department professors trying to apply learning algorithms to understand history better we have lawyers trying to apply machine learning inter-process legal humans and off-campus every company both the tech companies as well as a lot of other companies that you wouldn't consider tech companies everything from me faction companies healthcare companies the just six companies are also trying to apply machine learning so I think that um if you look at it on a factual basis the number of people doing very valuable machine learning projects today it's much greater than it was six months ago and six months ago is much greater than it was twelve months ago and the amount of value the amounts of exciting meaningful work being done in machine learning is very strongly going up and I think that given the rise of you know the amount of data we have as well as the new machine learning tools that we have it would be a long time before we run out of opportunities you have before before society as a whole has enough people where the machine learning skill set so just as maybe I don't know 20 years ago was a good time to start working on this internet thing a lot of people that started working on the internet like 20 years ago and fantastic careers I think today is a wonderful time to jump to machine learning and the number and the opportunities for you to do unique things that no one is no one else is doing right you are paying for you to go to logistics company and find an exciting way to apply machine learning will be very high because chances are that logistics company has no one else even working on this because you know they probably can they may not be able to hire a fantastic Stanford student as a graduate cs2 29 right girls don't they just on a lot of CSUN graduates around um so what I want to do today is do a quick intro talking about logistics and then we'll spend the second half of the day you know giving an overview and talk a little bit more about machine learning okay and oh and I apologize I think that this room according to that sign there seats what 300 something students I think we have like not quite 800 people and wrote in this class so if there are people outside and all of the classes are recorded broadcast on SCPD they're usually the videos usually made a very available same day so for those who they can't get into the room my apologies you know there are some years where even I had trouble getting into the room but I'm but hopefully you can wash you you better wash all of these things online shortly OSE yes yeah I don't know it's a bit complicated yeah thank you I think it's okay yeah okay yeah yeah for the next few classes you can squeeze in and use at the NCC so for now might be too complicated so quick and shows um oh I'm sorry I should have introduced myself my name is Andrew and I want to introduce some of the rest of the teaching team as well is a class coordinator she has been playing this role for many years now and helps keep the trains run on time and make sure that everything of course happens when it's supposed to so she'll be and then what throat cause my Santa be the co-head TS respectively a PhD students working with me and so bringing a lot of own technical experience technical experience in machine learning as well as practical know-how on how to make these things work and with the large class that we have we have a large ta team maybe I won't introduce all of the TAS here today but you meet many of them throughout the school sir but the TAS expertise span everything from conversions and language processing technology to robotics and so through this quarter as you work on your class projects I hope that you get a lot of help and advice and mentoring from the TAS all of which all of whom have deep expertise not just in machine learning but often in a specific vertical application area of machine learning so depend on what your projects we try to match you to a TA they can give you advice they're most relevant whatever project you end up working on um so you know go with this class I hope that after the next ten weeks you will be an expert in machine learning it turns out that you know and I hope that after this class you'll be able to go out and build very meaningful machine learning applications either in an academic setting where hopefully you can apply it to your problems in mechanical engineering Electrical Engineering and English and law and and education and all of this wonderful work that happens on campus as well as off the grass from Stanford to Bill apply to whatever jobs you find one of the things I find very exciting about machine learning is that it's no longer a sort of pure tech company only kind of thing right I think that many years ago machine learning it was like a thing that you know computer science department would do and that the elite AI companies like Google and Facebook and Baidu and Microsoft with you but now it is so pervasive that even companies that are not traditional tech companies see a huge need to apply these tools and I find a lot of the most exciting work these days and maybe some of you guys know my histories I'm a little bit is very I let the Google brain team which help Google transform from what was already a great company ten years ago to today which is a great AI company and then also let the AI group that might do and you know let the company's technology strategy to help I do also transform from what was already a green company many years ago to today arguably China's greatest AI company so having let the you know build the teams that let the AI transformations of two large tech companies III feel like that's a great thing to do but even beyond tech I think that um there's lot of exciting work to do as well to help other industries to help other sectors embrace machine learning and use these tools effectively but after this class I hope that each one of you will be well qualified to get a job at shiny tech company and do machine learning there or go into one of these other industries and do very valuable machine learning projects there um and in addition if any of you are taking this class with the primary goal of being able to do research in machine learning you know so actually some some of you I know are PhD students I hope that this class will also leave you well equipped to really read and understand research papers as well as you know be qualified to start pushing forward the state-of-the-art so let's see so today so just as machine learning is evolving rapidly the whole teaching team we've been constantly updating CS 229 as well so it's actually very interesting I feel like the pace of progress in machine learning has accelerated so it actually feels like that the amount we changed the cost year-over-year has been increasing over time so so if your friends that took the class last year you know things are a little bit different this year because we're constantly updating the class to keep up with what feels like slow accelerating progress in the whole field of machine learning so so so so there are some logistical changes for example we've gone from what we used to hand out paper copy of handouts that where we're trying to make this class digital-only but let me talk a little bit about prerequisites as well as in case your friends have taken this class before some of the differences for this year um so prerequisites we are going to assume that all of you have a knowledge of basic computer skills and principles so you know Big O notation Q stands binary trees hopefully you understand what all of those concepts are and assume that all we have a basic familiarity with probability right that hopefully you know what's the random variable what's the expected value of a random variable what's the variance of a random variable and if for some of you maybe especially the SCPD students taking there's enrollee if there's been you know some number of years since you lost the probability and statistics Falls we will have review sessions on Fridays where we'll go over some of this prerequisite material as well hopefully you know whether random variable is what the expected value is but if you are a little bit fuzzy on those concepts we'll go over them again at a discussion section on Friday also seeing the familiar basic linear algebra so hopefully that you know what the matrix was a vector how to multiply two matrices and multiplying majors in a vector if you know what an eigenvector then that's even better if you're not quite sure what an eigenvector is look over it uuugh but yeah we'll go over it I guess um and then um a large part of this class is having you practice these ideas through the homeworks as well as I mentioned later a open-ended project and so one there we've actually until now we used to use MATLAB in octave for their premiere assignments but this year we're trying to ship the permian Simon's to Python and so I think for a long time even today you know I sometimes use octaves their prototype because the syntax the octave is so nice and just run very simple experiments very quickly but I think the Machine there in the world you know really migrating I think from MATLAB Python world to increasing using MATLAB octave world to increasingly a Python maybe and then eventually for production Java or C++ kind of world and so we're rewriting a lot of the assignments that this causes quilter I've been having driving that process so that so that this course here you could do more of the assignments maybe most maybe all of the assignments in Python numpy instead now an oath of the only codes we all said you know we we actually encourage you to form study groups so you know up and I'm fascinated by education a long time for a long time studying education in pedagogy and how instructors like us can help support you to learn more efficiently and one of the lessons I've learned from the educational research literature is that for highly technical classes like this if you form study groups you will probably have an easier time right so so CS News and I would go for the highly technical material there's a lot of math so the programs are hard and they have a group of friends to study with you probably have an easier time because you can ask each other questions and work together help each other um where we ask you to draw the line or what we ask you to do relative to the standards on the codes is we ask that you do the homework problems by yourself right and and and more specifically is okay to discuss the homework problems or friends but if you but after discussing homework problems with friends we ask you to go back and write up the solutions by yourself without referring to notes that you know you and your friends have developed together okay the classes on the code is written clearly on the class handouts posted digitally on their website so if you ever have any questions about what there's a lot of collaboration and what isn't allowed please refer to that written document on the course website where we distract us more clearly but out of respect for the Stanford honor code as well as the your students kind of doing their own work we asked you to basically do your own work for the soca to discuss it but after discussing home problems with friends ultimately we asked you to write up your problems by yourself so that the homework submissions reflect your own work right and I care about this because turns out that having CS 239 you know CS 229 is one of those classes that employers recognize I don't know if you guys know but they're been um companies that have put up job ads that say stuff like so long as you got solace you complete the CST three now and we guarantee you get an interview right I've seen stuff like that and so I think you know in order to maintain that sanctity of what it means to be a CSU to nine computer I think and I all said all of you so the really do work or stay within the bounds of accepted of acceptable collaboration relative the honor codes let's see and I think that um if you know what this is and I think that one of the best parts of CS 339 it turns out is excuse me oh yeah sorry I'm gonna try looking for the mouse cursor all right serve all that might might might displays on not smear erisa so this is a little bit awkward um so one of the best parts of the class is she sorry about that right no mind I won't do this you could do that you could do yourself online later yeah I started using I started using Firefox recently in addition to Chrome it was just a mix-up um one of the best parts of the class is the class project and so you know one of the girls of the qualities to leave you well qualified to do a meaningful machine learning project and so one of the best ways to make sure you have that skill set is through this class and hopefully with the help of some of the TAS we want to support you to work on a small group to complete a meaningful machine learning project and so one thing I hope you start doing you know later today is to start brainstorming maybe of your friends some of the some of the class projects you might work on and the most common class project that you know people do in CSU's you know it's the picker area pick an application that excites you and to apply machine learning to it and see if it can build a good machine learning system for some application in the area and so if you go to the course website you know cs2 2/9 does time for the edu and look at previous year's projects you you you see machine learning projects applied to pretty much you know pretty much every imaginable application Under the Sun everything from no diagnosing cancer to creating arts to lots of projects apply to other areas of engineering applying to application areas in EE or my contouring or silver engineering or earthquake immersion and so on to applying it to understand literature it's applying it to know and and and and so if you look at the previous year's projects many of which are posted on the course website you can use that as inspiration to see the types of projects students complete completing this class are able to do and also encourage you to you can look at that for inspiration to get a sense of what you'll be able to do at the conclusion of this class and also see if looking at previous year's projects gives you inspiration for what you might do yourself so we also know we invite you I guess to do class projects in small groups and so after class today also encourage you to start making friends in the class both for the purpose of forming study groups as well for the purpose and maybe finding a small group to do a class project with we ask you to form project groups of up to size three most project groups end up being size two or three if you insist on doing it by yourself right without any partners that's actually okay - you're welcome to do that but but but I think often you know having one or two others to work with may give you an easier time and for projects of exceptional scope if you have a very large project it just cannot be done by three people sometimes you know let us know and we're open to work with to some project groups of size four but our expectation but we do whole projects you know with a group of four to a higher standard than project group size one to three so so what that means is that if your project team size is one two or three persons the grading is one criteria if your project group is bigger than three persons we use a stricter criteria when it comes to creating class projects okay um oh and that reminds me I know that the scene so for most of you since is since this starts at 9:30 a.m. on the first day of the quarter for many of you this may be this / your very first cause at Stanford for how many of you does your very first cause at Stanford Wow cool okay awesome great welcome to Stanford oh and there's someone next to you just raise their hand actually raise your hand again so I hope that you know maybe off the class today if someone makes you raise their hand welcome them to Stanford and then say hi and show yourself and good friends I'll do it cool nice nice to see so many of you yeah all right so just a bit more logistics so let's see in addition to the main lectures that we'll have here on Mondays and Wednesdays since 39 also has discussion sections on held on Fridays that are and everything we do including the see all the all the lectures and discussion sections are recorded and broadcast through SCPD through the online website and one of and discussion section are taught usually by the TAS on Fridays and attendance at discussion sections is optional and what I mean is that you you know you punch up some promise there won't be material on the midterm that will sneak in from the section so it's hundred-percent optional and you will be able to do all the homework and appropriate projects without attending in this question section but what we'll use the discussion section for for the first three discussion sections so you know this week next week week after that we'll use the discussion sections to go over prerequisite material and great to Jeff so go over linear algebra or basic crime statistics teach a little about Python numpy in case you're less familiar with those frameworks so do that for the first few weeks and then for the discussion sections that are held later this quarter will usually use them to go over a more advanced optional material for example cs50 now involved in learning algorithms you you hear about in the class rely on convex optimization algorithms but we want to focus the class on the learning algorithms and spend less time on convex optimization so if you want to come and hear about more advanced concepts in convex optimization we'll defer that to a discussion section and then there are few other advanced topics hidden Markov models time series that were planning to defer to the Friday discussion sections okay so let's see cool and oh and final bit of logistics there'll be there are digital tools that some of you have seen but for this class will drive a lot of the discussion through the online website Piazza how many of you abuse Piazza Cavour okay cool mostly Wow all of you that's pretty amazing good so so online discussion board for those of you that haven't seen it before but definitely encourage you to participate actively on Piazza and also to answer all the students questions I think that one of the best ways to learn as was contribute you know back to the course as a whole is if you see someone else ask a question on Piazza if you jump in and have answer that that that often helps you and helps your classmates so I strongly encourage you to do that for those of you that have a private question you know sometimes we have students reaching out to us too with a personal matter or something that you know it's not appropriate to share on the public forum in which case you're welcome to email us at the cross email address as well and we also and the class the email address the clock teaching staffs email address on the course website you can find it there in contact us but for anything technical or anything reasonable to share the class which includes most technical questions that most logistical questions write questions like you know chief can you confirm what date is it midterm or you know what happens can you confirm Wednesday handout for this going on and so on for questions are not personal or private in nature strongly encourage you to post on Piazza rather than emailing us because statistically you actually get a faster answer posting this on post posting on Piazza then then you know if you wait for one of us to respond to you and we'll be using great scope as well for online grading if you don't know why brace go up is don't worry about it well we'll send you links and show you how to use it data oh and again relative to want one loss which is a real thing to plan for unlike previous yes when we taught CS 339 so we're constantly updating the syllabus right the technical content to try to show you the latest machine learning algorithms and the to pick up little changes we're making this year I guess one is a Python instead of MATLAB and the other one is instead of having a midterm exam you know that's a timed midterm we're planning to have a take hold midterm this quarter this day so I know some people just breathing sharply when I said that I don't know what that means was that shock full happiness don't worry midterms are fun you love it all right oh so that's it for the that's it for the logistical aspects let me check with you and so let me check there any questions oh yeah go ahead oh yeah so that's such thing oh let's see I think has offered in spring and one of the presses oh yes and I was teaching it so someone else is teaching it in Spring Quarter I actually did not know it was going to be offered in winter so I think a big guy teaching notes in Neverending right teaching it in spring and I don't think is often in winter well this kind of sections be recorded yes they will be oh and by the way if you wonder why I'm recording that I'm repeating the question I know it feels weird I'm recording for the microphone so that so that people watching those at home can hear the question but both the lectures and the discussion sections will be will be recorded and put on the website maybe the one thing we do there's not recorded and broadcast at the office hours right oh oh but I think this year we have a 60 hour how many on 60 office hours per week right yeah so so so hopefully I just again we're constantly trying to improve the cause in previous years one of the feedback we got was that the officers are really crowded so so we have 60 60 hours of football 60 offers all slots per week this that seems like long so hopefully if you need to track down one of us track down the teeth to get help hopefully that'll make it easier for you to do so good say okay well oh well logistical things like when Homer said you be covering lectures we have a yes so we have four plans homeworks yeah and if you go to the if you go to the course website and click on the syllabus link that has a calendar with when each homework assignments called and when Opie do so for homeworks and project proposal due few weeks from now and then final projects due at the end of the quarter but all the other exact dates are listed on the course website oh sure yes difference between this class into 39a let me think how does dead yes so yeah I know I was debating earlier this morning how to answer that is no doubt that a few times so I think that what has happened at Stanford is that the volume of demand for machine learning education is just right skyrocketing because I think everyone sees everyone wants to learn this stuff and so so whooping so the computer science department has been trying to grow the number of machine learning offerings we have we actually kept the enrollment at CSC 39a at a relatively low number at a hundred students so I actually don't want to encourage too many of you to sign up because I think we might be hitting the enrollment cap already so so please don't all sign up for CC 90 because we - 398 does not have the capacity this quarter but since 229 a is a much less mathematical and much more quite relatively more apply version of machine learning and so I guess I'm teaching 69 ACS 230 NCSU now in this quarter of the 3 CS 229 is the most mathematical it has a little bit less apply than 63 9 a which is more apply machine learning and since 230 which is deep learning my advice to students is that 63 962 9s is let me write this down so since 229 a is taught in a flipped classroom format which means that students taking and will mainly watch videos on the Coursera website and do a lot of programming exercises and then meet for weekly discussion sections but it's a smaller class with captain Romans I would advise you that if you feel ready for cs50 9 + CS 2:30 to do those but cs50 9 you know because of the math this is a this is a very heavy workload and pretty challenging class and so if you're not sure we're ready for CCTV 969 a may be a good thing to take first and then cs50 90s TV 9 a cover a broader range of machine learning algorithms and cs2 30 is more focused on deep learning algorithms specifically right which is a much narrower set of algorithms but it is you know one of the hottest areas of deep learning there is not that much overlap in content between the three classes so if you actually take all three you learn relatively different things from all of them in the positive has students simultaneously take to 29 and 229 a and there is a little bit of overlap you know they do kind of cover related algorithms but from different points of view so so some people actually take multiple of these classes at the same time but sooner nine is more applied a bit more you know practical know-how hands-on and so on and much less mathematical and CS 230 is also less mathematical more applied more about kind of getting to work whereas see Susan honey we do much more mathematical derivations in c ester's so why'd you say that what I would generally prefer students not do that in the interest of time but what what do you want oh I see sure go for it who's enrolled in 239 to 3000 not that many of you interesting oh that's actually really interesting cool yeah thank you yeah I just didn't want to say the presence of students using this as a forum to run surveys so that was that was that was an interesting question so thank you cool all right and by the way I think you know just one thing about Stanford is on the AI world machine they're in the world yeah is bigger than machine learning right machine is bigger than deep learning um one of the great things about being a Stanford student is you can and I think should take multiple classes right I think that you know since we're now in has for many years been the call of the machine learning world at Stanford but even beyond CS 239 is worth your while to take multiple classes including multiple perspectives so so if you want to be really effective you know after you drive don't stand there you do want to be an exponent machine learning you do want to be an expert and deep learning and you probably want to know probably in statistics maybe you want to know bit of confidence optimization maybe you want to know bit more about the force when learning know a little bit about planning a little bit about lots of things so so I actually encourage you to take multiple classes like this if there are no more questions let's go on to talk a bit about machine learning so all right so in the remainder of the sauce what I'd like to do is give a quick overview of you know the major areas of machine learning and also and and also give you absolute overview of the things you learn in the next ten weeks so you know what is machine learning right it seems to be everywhere these days and it's useful for so many places and and I think that and you know and and I feel like if either just to share view my personal bias right you you read the news about these people making so much money building learning algorithms I think that's great I hope I hope all of you go make up all the money but the thing I find even more exciting is the meaningful work we could do right I think that you know I think that every time there's a major technological disruption which there is now through machine learning it gives us an opportunity to remake large parts of the world and if we behave ethically in a principled way and use these super powers of machine learning to do things that you know helps people's lives right maybe we could maybe you can improve the health care system maybe you can improve give every child a personalized tutor maybe you can make a democracy run better rather than make it run worse but I think that the meaning I find in machine learning is that there's so many people that are so eager for us to go in and help them with these tools that if you become good at these tools it gives you an opportunity to really remake some peace some meaningful piece of the world hopefully in a way that helps other people and makes the world kind of makes the world a better place is very cliche in Silicon Valley but but I think you know with these tools you actually have the power to do that and they've got make a ton of money that's great too but I find a much greater meaning in the work we could do but um despite all the excitement of machine learning what is machine learning so let me give you a couple definitions of machine learning author Samuel whose claim to fame was building a checkers playing program defined it as follows fields I think is computable II learned well being explicitly programmed and you know interesting when when also samuel many many decades ago wrote the checkers playing program the debates of the day was coming computer ever do something that it wasn't explicitly told to do and Arthur Samuel wrote checkers playing program but that through self play learned what are the patterns of checkerboard that are more likely to lead to win versus more likely lead to a loss and learn to be even better than Arthur Samuel the author himself at playing checkers so back then there was viewed as a remarkable result there the computer program huh you know that could write a piece of software to do something that the computer program that himself could not do right because this program became better and also Samuel at the toss of played checkers and I think today we are used to computers or machine learning algorithms outperforming humans on so many tasks but it turns out that when you choose a narrow tasks like speech recognition on a certain type of tasks you can maybe surpass human level performance if it was a narrow toss like playing the game of goal then by throwing really tons of computation power at it and self play you can have a computer you know become very good at these narrow tasks but this is maybe one of the first such examples in history of computing and I think this is still one of the most widely cited definitions right gives computer disability learn while being explicitly programs um my friend Tom Mitchell in his textbook defined this as well-posed learning problem program said to learn from experience ee respect to toss T on some performance measure people on t as measured by P improves experience you know and III asked on this I asked Tom if he wrote this definition just because he wanted it to rhyme he did not say yes but I I don't know um but in this definition the experience II for the case of playing checkers the experience he would be the experience of having the checklist the program play tons of games against itself so computers lots of patience sit there for days playing games of checkers against itself so that's the experience II the toss T is the toss the playing checkers and performance measure P maybe was the chance of this program winning the next game of checkers it plays against the next opponent right so so we say that this is a well-posed learning problem doing anything checkers now within this set of ideas of machine learning there are many different tools we use in machine learning and so in the next ten weeks you learn about a variety of these different tools and so the first of them and the most widely used one is supervised learning let's see I want to switch to the whiteboard do you guys know how do i erase the screen so what I want to do today is really go over some of the major categories of machine learning tools and and so that what you learn in the next by the end of this quarter so the most widely used machine learning - is today is supervised learning actually then we check how many of you know what supervised learning is two-thirds half of you maybe okay cool let me just briefly define it um here's one example let's say you have a database of housing prices and so I'm gonna plot your data set where on the horizontal axis I want to plot the size of the house in square feet you know and then the vertical axis will plot the price of the house right and maybe a dataset looks like that and so horizontal axis I guess we call this X and vertical axis we'll call that Y so um the supervised learning problem is given the data set like this to find the relationship mapping from X to Y and so for example let's see yeah let's say let's say you have a let's say you are fortunate enough to own a house in Colorado and you're trying to sell it and you want to know how to price the house so maybe your house has a size you know of that amount on the horizontal axis this is five inches square feet 1,000 square feet 1,500 square feet so your house is 1250 square feet right and you want to know you know how do you price this house so given this dataset one thing you can do is fit a straight line to it right and then you could estimate so predict the price to be whatever value you read off on the vertical axis so in supervised learning you are given a data set with infos X and labels Y and your goal is to learn a from X to Y right now fitting a straight line to the data is maybe the simplest possible maybe the simplest possible learning algorithm maybe that one of the simplest on learning algorithms given they said like there's there many possible ways to learn the mapping to learn the function mapping from the input size to the estimated price and so maybe you want to fit a quadratic function instead maybe that actually fits a date a little bit better and so how do you choose among different models will be either automatically or manually vention will be will be something we'll spend a lot of time talking about now to give a little bit more to define a few more things this pickle example is a problem called a regression problem and the term regression refers to that D value Y you're trying to predict is continuous right in contrast here is a here's a different type of problem so problem that some one friends were working on and I'll simplify it was was a healthcare problem where they were looking at breast cancer breast tumors and trying to decide if a tumor is benign or malignant right so tumor you know serve a lump in ER in a woman's breast is it can be malign or cancerous or benign meaning you know roughly there's not that harmful and so if on the horizontal axis you plot the size of a tumor and on the vertical axis you plot is it malignant or not so malignant means harmful rate and some tumors are harmful some are not and so whether it's malignant or not takes only two values one or zero and so you may have a data set like that right and given this can you learn a mapping from X to Y so that if a new patient walks into your office was in the doctor's office and the tumor size is you know say this can i learning algorithm figure out from this day there that it was probably well based on this data set it looks like there's a there's a high chance that that tumor is malignant so so this is an example of a classification problem and the term classification refers to that Y here takes on a discrete number of variables so for a regression problem Y is a real number I guess technically prices can be rounded off to the nearest dollar instead so prices aren't really real numbers because you pretty not price of how's that like pi times 1 million or whatever but so but for all practical purposes prices are continuous so we call them housing price prediction to be a regression problem whereas if you have two values that possible help was zero one call that classification problem if you have K discrete outputs so if the tumor can be malignant or if there are five types of cancer where and so you have one of five possible outputs then there's also a classification problem that the output is discrete now I want to find a different way to visualize this data set which is let me throw a line on top and I'm just gonna you know mat all this data on the horizontal axis upward onto a line but I'm going to use a symbol ol to denote I hope what I did was clear so I took the two sets of examples that positive and negative examples positive example was this one negative example zero and I took all of these examples and kind of push them up onto a straight line and I used two symbols I use OHS to denote negative examples and I use processes in our positive examples okay so this is just a different way of visualizing the same data but drawing it on a line and using you know two symbols to denote the two discrete values around one right so um it turns out that in both of these examples the input X was one-dimensional it was a single real number for most of the machine learning application to work with the input X will be multi-dimensional and you won't be given just one number and also predict another number instead you often be given multiple features or multiple numbers to predict another number so for example instead of just using two messiahs to predict to estimate malignancy open malignant versus benign tumors you may instead have two features where one is tumor size and the second is age of the patient and be given a data set maybe I'll sit and be given the data set that looks like that well now your task is given two input features so X's tumor size and age you know like a two dimensional vector and your toss is given these two input features to predict whether a given tumor is malignant or benign so the new patient walks in the doctor's office and that the tumor size is here and the ages here so that point there that hopefully you conclude that you know this patients tumors probably benign very corresponding oh that's a negative example and so one thing one thing you learn next week is a learning algorithm that can further straight line to the data as follows kind of like that to separate out the positive negative example several out the holes and the crosses and so next week you learn about the logistic regression algorithm which and do that okay so one of the most interesting things you learn about is let's see so in this example I drew a dataset with two input features when I said I have friends that actually worked on the breast cancer prediction problem and in practice you usually have a lot more than one or two features and usually you have so many features you can't plot on the board right and so for an actual breast cancer prediction problem my friends are working on this well we're using many other features such as don't worry about what these need mean I guess clump thickness you know uniformity of cell size uniformity of cell shape right at Heejun how will the cells sync together don't worry about what these means but if you're actually doing this in a actual medical application there's a good chance that you'll be using a lot more features than just two and this means that you actually can't plot this data right it's too high dimensional you can't plot things higher than three dimensional maybe four dimensional something right and so we have all the features are you difficult to plot this data I'll come back to this in a second in learning theory and one of the things you learn about so as we develop our rhythms you learn how to build regression algorithms or classification algorithms that can deal with these relatively larger number of features one of the most fascinating results you learn is that you also learn about an algorithm called support vector machine which uses not one or two or three or ten or hundred or million input features but uses an infinite number of input features right and so so so just be clear if in this example the state of a patient will represents as one number you know tumor size in this example you get two features so the state of a patient will be represented using two numbers tumor size in the age if you use this list of features maybe a patient arrives enter with five or six numbers but there's an algorithm called the support vector machine that allows you to use an infinite dimensional vector to represent patients and how do you deal with that and how can a computer even store an infinite dimensional vector right I mean you know computer memory you can store one girl number two real numbers but you can't store an infinite number of real numbers in the computer without running on the memory or processor speed or whatever so so how do you do that so we talked about support vector machines and specifically the technical method called kernels you learn how to build during the algorithms that work with so that it infinitely long lissa features infinitely long list of features for which you can imagine that if you have an infinitely long list of numbers to represent a patient that might give you a lot of information about that patient and so that is one of the relatively effective learning algorithm problems um so that's supervised learning and you know let me just some play a video show you a fun slightly older example of supervised there in the previous hands what this means but at the heart of supervised learning is the idea that during training you are given inputs X together with the labels Y and you're given both at the same time and the job of your learning algorithm is to find a mapping so that given a new X you can map it to the most appropriate output Y so this is a very old video made by a Dean Pomerleau known for a long time as well on using supervised learning for autonomous driving this does not save the art for Toms driving anymore but it actually does remarkably well oh and as you you hear a few technical terms like back propagation you learn all those techniques in this cause and by the end of class you've really built a learning algorithm much more effective than what you see here but let's let's see this application could you turn up the volume maybe have that are you guys getting volleyball yeah I see alright I'll narrate this Oh so I'll be using artificial neural network to drive this vehicle that was built at carnegie mellon university many years ago and what happens is during training it watches the human drive the vehicle and I think ten times a second it digitizes the image in front of the vehicle and so that's a picture taken by a front-facing camera and what it does is in order to collect labelled data the car while the human is driving it records both the image such as the scene here as well as the steering direction that was chosen by human so at the bottom here is the image turned into grayscale and lower res and on top let me pose this for a second this is the driver direction the phone's kind of blurry but this Texas driver direction so this is the Y label the label Y that the human driver chose and so the position of this white bar of this white blob shows how the human is choosing to steer the car so in this in this image the white blob is a little bit to the left of center so the humans you know steering just a little bit to the left this second line here is the output of the neural network and initially the neural network doesn't know how to drive and so it's just outputting this white schmear everywhere you say you know I don't know do I Drive left right center I don't know so stop putting this gray blur everywhere and as the algorithm learns using the back propagation learning algorithm or gradient descent which you learn about you actually learn about gradient descent this Wednesday you see that the neural networks output becomes less and less of this white shmear this white blur but starts become sharper and starts to mimic more accurately the human selected driving direction so this um there's an example of supervised learning because the human driver demonstrates inputs X and outputs y maybe if you see this in front of the car steer like that so that's x and y and after the learning algorithm has learned you can then well he pushes a button takes a hand off the steering you know and then it's using this network to drive itself right digitizing the image in front of the note taking this image and passing it through the learning algorithm through the trained neural network letting the neural network select the steering direction and then using a little motor to turn the wheel this is a slightly more advanced version which has trained two separate models one for I think a two-lane road one for a four-lane roads so that's the so the second and third lines this is for a two-lane road this is a four-lane road and the arbitrator is another algorithm that tries to decide whether the two lane of the four-lane road model is the more appropriate one for a particular given situation and so as Alvin destroying excuse me a one named world or two lane road so it says driving from a one lane road here toward an intersection the the algorithm realizes is just switch over from I think I forget what I think the one lane or network today to the two lane your network and one or season okay oh all right fine we just see the final dramatic moment as searching for a one-day road to tuning all right and I think you know so this is just using supervised learning to take as input what's in front of your car to decide on steering direction this is not so the odds for how self-driving cars are built today but you know you could do some things in some limited context and I think within several weeks you actually be able to build something that is more sophisticated than this um so after supervised learning we will in this class to spend a bit of time talking about machine learning strategy you know I think on the class nails we annotate this as a learning theory but what that means is um I want to give you the tools to gaulden apply learning algorithms effectively and I think I've been fortunate to have you know to know a lot of I think that um I've been fortunate to have you know over the years constantly visited lots of great tech companies more than ones that I've dead that I've been probably associated with right but often just a home friend zone I visit various tech companies of the Sun whose products I'm sure installed on your cell phone but I often visit tech companies and you know talk to the Machine there any themes and see what they're doing and see if I can help them out and what I see is that there's a huge difference in the effectiveness of how two different teams could apply the exact same learning algorithm and I think that what I've seen savvy is that sometimes there will be a team even in some of the best tech companies right the the elite AI companies in multiple of them where you go talk to a team and they'll tell you about something they've been working on for six months and then you can quickly take a look at the data and and hear that did not the album isn't quite working and sometimes you could look like what they're doing and go yeah you know I could have told you six months ago the disapproval is never gonna work right and what I find is that the most skill machine learning practitioners are very strategic by which I mean that your skill at deciding when you work on a machine learning project know you have a lot of decisions to make right do you collect more data do you try a different learning algorithm do you ran faster GPUs to train your learning oven for longer or if you collect more data what type of data is you collect or for all of these architecture choices using neural networks what vector machine which is regression which one do you pick but there are a lot of decisions you need to make when building these learning algorithms so one thing that's quite unique to the way we teach is we want to help you become more systematic in driving machine learning as a sabbatical engineering discipline so that when one day your work on machine learning project you can efficiently figure out what to do next and sometimes make an analogy to how to a software engineering you know I many years ago I had a friend that would debug code by compiling it and then this friend will look all these syntax errors right that you know see pluses compiler outputs and they thought that the best way to eliminate the errors is the delete all the lines of code with syntax errors and that was their first serious thing so that did not go well right took me a while to persuade them to start doing that Oh but-but-but-but so it turns out that when you run a learning algorithm you know it almost never works the first time is just life and the way you go about debugging the learning algorithm will have a huge impact on your efficiency on how quickly you can build effective learning systems and I think until now too much of the of this process of making your learning Urban's work well has been a black magic kind of process where you know as it's the decades so when you run something and don't know why it's not working I hate what I do and says oh yeah I'll do that and then and then because he's so experienced it works but I think um what we're trying to do with the discipline of machine learning is to evolve it from a black magic tribal knowledge experience based thing to a systemic engineering process right and so later this quarter as we talk about machine learning strategy or talk about learning theory you try to suspect to give you tools on how to go about strategizing so can be very efficient in how you how you yourself how you can lead a team to build an effective learning system because I don't want you to be one of those people that you know waste six months on some direction that maybe could have relatively quickly figured out what's not promising well maybe one loss analogy if you if you use the optimizing code right making code run faster not tell me if you learn that less experience software engineers will just dive in and optimize the code to try to make it run faster right let's take the C++ and code in the 70 or something but more experienced people will run the profiler to try to figure out what part of your code is actually the whole night and then just focus on changing on that so one things hope to do this quarter is convey to you some of these more systemic engineering principles oh and actually this is a actually I've been down I've been writing this up actually so how many of you have heard a machine there on in your name oh just a few of you interesting so actually - so if any of you interested just in my spare time I've been writing a book to try to codify systemic engineering principles for machine learning and so if you are and so if you want a you know free draft copy of the book sign up for a mailing list here I tend to just write stuff and put it on the internet for you so if you want a free drop copy of the book you know go to this website enter your email address and the website was saying Jerry copy of the book they'll talk a little bit about these interview principles as well okay all right so so first object machine learning second subject learning theory and the third major subject we'll talk about is deep learning and so you know the lot of tools in machine learning and many of them are worth learning about and I use many different tools the machine learning you know for many different applications there's one subset of machine learning that's really hot right now because it's just advancing very rapidly which is deep learning and so we'll spend a bit of time talking about deep learning so they can understand the basics of how the training your network as well but I think that um whereas 2:29 covers a much broader set of out rules which are all useful see su-30 more narrowly covers just deep learning so other than deep learning slash after after deep learning such new neural networks the other the the fall of both of the five major topics we'll cover will be an unsupervised learning so one is unsupervised learning so you saw me draw a picture like this just now right and this would be a classification problem like the tumor malignant benign problems this is a classification problem and that was a supervised learning problem because you have to learn the function mapping from X to Y unsupervised learning would be if I give you a data set like this with no labels so you just give in inputs X and no why and you're asked to find me something interesting in this data figure out you know interesting structure in this data and so in this data set it looks like there are two clusters and then unsupervised learning algorithm which you learn about called k-means clustering will discover this this structure in the data other examples and so I was learning you know if you actually Google News is a very interesting website sometimes I use it to look up right latest news there's an only example but Google News every day crawls or reads many many thousands or tens of thousands of news articles on the Internet and groups them together right for example there's a set of articles on DPP all well still and it has taken a lot of the articles written by different reporters and grouped them together so you can you know figure out that what BP Macondo all well write that this is a CNN article about the whole world still there's a guardian article about all well spill this example of a clustering algorithm where is taking these different new sources and figuring out that these are all stories kind of about the same thing and other examples of clustering just getting data and figuring out what groups belong together all the work on genetic data this is a visualization of the genetic microwave radiator we're giving it like this you can group individuals into different types of individuals at different characteristics or clustering algorithms grouping this type of data together is used to organize computing clusters you know figure out what machines workloads are more related to each other and organize communities probably so to take a social network like LinkedIn or Facebook or other social networks and figure out which are the groups of friends on which are the cohesive communities within a social network or market segmentation actually many companies I've worked with look at the customer database and cluster the users together so you can say that looks like where four types of users you know looks like that there are the young professionals looking to develop themselves they're the you know soccer moms and soccer dads that the discount in this case who can then market to the different market segments separately and and actually many years ago my friend Andrew Moore was using this type of data for astronomical data analysis group together galaxies question Oh is almost worse than the clustering knows not so as well as well as learning brought me is the concept of using unlabeled data so just X and finding interesting things about it right so for example actually here's shoot this won't work with all audio will do this later in the clock in the class I guess maybe I'll save and do this later cocktail party problem is another unsupervised learning problem reading the audio for this to explain this though everything how to explain this you know cocktail party problems I'll try to do the demo when we can get all your work on this laptop there's a problem where if you have a noisy room and you stick multiple microphones in the room every call overlapping voices so there no labels readers and multiple microphones my array of microphones in a room with lots of people talking how can you have the algorithm separate out the people's voices so that's an unsupervised learning problem because there are no labels you just stick microphones in the room and have a record different people's voices over that voices multiple Utah at the same time and then haven't tried to separate out people's voices and one of the pro next Assizes you do later is if we have you know five people talking so each microphone there cause five people's overlapping voices right because you know each microphone here's five people at the same time how can you have an algorithm separate out these voices so you can't clean recordings of just one voice at a time so that's called a cocktail party problem and the algorithm you used to do this is called ICA independent components analysis and that's something you implement in one of the latest homework exercises and there are other examples of us who has learning as well the Internet has tons of unlabeled text later you just sucked down data from the internet there no labels necessarily but can you learn interesting things about language figure out what figure out I don't know one of the best cited results recently was learning analogies like you know man is the woman as king of the Queen right or what Tokyo mister Japan as Washington DC's the United States right to learn and energies like that some say you can learn analogies like that from unlabeled data just from text on the internet so there's also unsupervised learning okay um so after on sooo eyes learning oh and I'm surprised earning so you know machine learning is very useful today turns out that most of the recent wave of economic value created by machine learning is through supervised learning but there are important use cases for unsupervised learning as well so I use them in my work occasionally and there's also beating edge for a lot of exciting research and then the final topic find out the five topics we cover so talk about supervised learning machine learning strategy deep learning unsupervised learning and then the fifth one is reinforcement learning is this which is um let's say I give you the keys to Stanford on this helicopter this hyung copters actually sitting in my office I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it and I'll see the ready program to make it fly right so how do you do that so this is a video of a helicopter flying the audio is just a lot of helicopter noise so that's not important but uh well zoom out the video you can see it responds in the sky right but so you can use learning out of yeah that's kind of cool I was the cameraman that day oh but so you can use there any algorithms to get you know robots to do pretty interesting things like this and it turns out that a good way to do this is through reinforcement learning so what's reinforcement learning um it turns out that no one knows what's the optimal way to fly a helicopter right if you find helicopter you have to control sticks that you're moving but no one knows what's the octal way to move the control sticks so that way you can get a helicopter fly itself is let the helicopter do whatever you think of it us training a dog right you can't teach a dog the optimal way to behave but actually how many have a pet dog a pet cat before it's fascinating okay so I had a pet dog when I was a kid and my family made it my job to train the dog so how do you train at all you let the dog do whatever it once and then whenever the Hays well there you go oh good dog and when it misbehaves you go bad dog and then over time the dog learns to do more of the good don't things and fear of the bad dog things and so reinforcement learning is a bit like that right I don't know what's the awful way to fly a helicopter so you let the helicopter do whatever it wants and then whenever it flies well you know doesn't mean everybody whines or flies accurately without getting around too much you go oh good helicopter and when it crashes to go bad helicopter and it's the job of the reinforcement learning algorithms to figure out how to control it over time so as to get more of a good helicopter things and fear that bad couple of things um and I think um well just one more video yeah all right and so again given a robot like this I actually don't know how the programmer actually you know robot like this as a Lolich joints right so how do you get a robot like this to climb more obstacles so well this is actually a robot dog so you can actually say good dog dog but by giving those signals called a reward signal you can have a learning algorithm figure out by itself how's the optimize the reward therefore climb over these types of obstacles and I think recently the most famous application is a very for student learning happened for game playing playing Atari games or playing a game of gold can alphago I think that uh IIIi I think that uh game play has made for some remarkable stunts a remarkable PR but I'm also equally excited or maybe even more excited about the integrals their reinforcement or anything is making it's a robotics applications so I think I think yeah reinforcement has been proven to be fantastic for playing games is also getting making real traction in optimizing robots and optimizing logistic system things like that so you learn about all these things last thing for today I hope that you will start to tell me people in the class to make friends phone project partners and study groups and if you have any questions you know dog on the Piazza ask you questions let's help others answer the questions so let's break for today and I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday you
