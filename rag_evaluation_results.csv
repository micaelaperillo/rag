I have some programming experience and I want to learn about object-oriented programming in Python. Can you explain what a class is?,"['Hello and welcome back to our Python series! Today, we\'re diving into two fundamental concepts in Python: classes and data structures. If you\'re comfortable with the basics like variables and loops, you\'re ready for this.\n\nLet\'s start with classes. Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.\n\nHere\'s how you define a simple class in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    # This is a special method called the initializer or constructor.\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def bark(self):\n        return ""Woof!""\n\n    def get_details(self):\n        return f""{self.name} is {self.age} years old.""\n``', 'Welcome to our advanced Python session.
